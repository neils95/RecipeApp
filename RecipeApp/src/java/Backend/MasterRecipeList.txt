Ingredients
3 cups cornstarch
1 1/2 cups flour
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
24 ounces beer
4 to 6 colossal onions, 4-inch diameter or larger
Seasoned Flour (recipe follows) *
Oil for deep-frying
Directions
Creamy Chili Sauce (recipe follows) **
To make batter, mix cornstarch, flour and seasonings until well blended. Add beer; mix well. Set aside. For each onion, cut about 3/4-inch off the top of the onion; peel onion. With cut side of the onion up, cut into the onion, top to bottom, to form 12 to 16 pie-shaped wedges, which will become the &quot;petals&quot; but do NOT cut through the bottom (root end) of the onion. Using a paring knife cut off the &quot;petals&quot; in the center of the onion (about a 1-inch diameter circle). Do not cut a hole through the onion. Dip cut onion into seasoned flour and remove excess by shaking. Stir beer batter, then dip floured onion into batter and remove excess by gently shaking. Holding onion upright, separate &quot;petals&quot; to coat thoroughly with batter. Heat oil in deep fat fryer or deep saucepan to 375 to 400 F. Your container should never be more than half full of oil. There should be enough oil to cover the onion and to allow the onion to move freely in the saucepan. Do not allow the fat to smoke. Gently place onion in the fryer basket or other wire-frying basket. Deep-fry for 1 1/2 minutes. Turn over and fry 1 to 1 1/2 minutes longer or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Place onion upright in shallow bowl and cut out root end with a circular cutter or apple corer. Serve hot with Creamy Chili Sauce. (You can place a small bowl of sauce in the center of the onion.)
* Seasoned Flour: Combine 2 cups flour, 4 teaspoons paprika, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; mix well.
** Creamy Chili Sauce: Combine 1 cup each mayonnaise and dairy sour cream, 1/4 cup chili sauce and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; mix well.

Potatoes Bravas

Rating:

Ingredients
2 lbs waxy potatoes (red or yellow)
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
1 onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 Tbsp pimenton (smoked Spanish paprika)
pinch cayenne (if using sweet pimenton - omit if using spicy)
1/2 tsp cumin
~1 lb chopped tomatoes, fresh or canned
1 Tbsp sherry vinegar
salt
Directions
Preheat the oven to 450 degreees.
Prepare the potatoes: Put the potatoes in a pot, and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until they're tender (about 15 minutes). Remove, and allow to cool slightly. When they're cool enough to handle, cut them in quarters into fat wedges. Toss with 1/4 cup of the olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and place on a baking pan. Roast in the oven, turning once, until crusty and slightly browned (about 10-15 minutes per side).
While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the Brava sauce: Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat in a heavy skillet. Saute the onion until translucent and soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until tender, another 5 minutes. Stir in the pimenton, cumin, and cayenne (if using). Add the tomatoes, and simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors. Stir in the vinegar, then puree mixture in a blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt.
To serve, drizzle the sauce either under or over the cooked potato wedges, in whatever manner seems most aesthetically pleasing. Enjoy, ideally with a glass of wine.

Cheesy Bean Dip
Rating:
2
Ingredients
1 can refried beans
1 packet taco seasoning
1 tub sour cream
1 pkg shredded cheddar cheese
1 big tomato
1 small can olives
1 bunch chives
Directions
Step 1: Dice the tomato (I usually scoop out the seeds so the dip doesn’t become runny) and mince the chives (for garnish). Set aside.
Step 2: Next, mix the taco seasoning into the beans until combined evenly then spread the mixture at the bottom of a casserole dish.
Step 3: Layers: Spread the sour cream directly on top of the beans and follow that with a sprinkle of a nice heaping layer of cheese (about half the package). Then evenly distribute the tomatoes and olives (and bacon bits if you have some on hand) on top of the cheese. Finish this off by sprinkling the rest of the cheese on top.
Step 4: Pop this bad boy into the oven at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is nice and gooey. Garnish with chopped chives.

Kale and Quinoa Pilaf
Rating:
3
Ingredients
1 cup quinoa
1 bunch lacinato kale, washed and chopped into 1" lengths
1 meyer or regular lemon, zested and juiced
2 scallions, minced (optional)
1 tablespoon toasted walnut oil or olive oil
3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese or feta cheese
salt and pepper
Directions
Bring 2 cups of salted water to a boil in a pot. Add the quinoa, cover, and lower the heat until it is just enough to maintain a simmer. Let simmer for 10 minutes, then top with the kale and re-cover. Simmer another 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and allow to steam for 5 more minutes.
While the quinoa is cooking, take a large serving bowl and combine half of the lemon juice (reserving the other half), all of the lemon zest, scallions, walnut or olive oil, pine nuts, and cheese.
Check the quinoa and kale when the cooking time has completed -- the water should have absorbed, and the quinoa will be tender but firm, and the kale tender and bright green. If the quinoa still has a hard white center, you can steam a bit longer (adding more water if needed). When the quinoa and kale are done, fluff the pilaf, and tip it into the waiting bowl with the remaining ingredients. As the hot quinoa hits the scallions and lemon it should smell lovely. Toss to combine, seasoning with salt and pepper, and the remaining lemon juice if needed.

Ingredients
3  tablespoons dried sage leaves
3  tablespoons dried savory leaves
1-1/2  teaspoons whole white or black peppercorns
1  teaspoon celery salt
1  teaspoon paprika
1  10- to 12-pound turkey
Pear Stuffing (see recipe below)
Cooking oil or olive oil
1/4  cup all-purpose flour
Chicken broth or water
Salt and ground black pepper (optional)
Autumn fruits, such as pears, crabapples, and lady apples, and assorted fresh herbs, such as tricolor sage, sage, or bay laurel (optional)
Directions
1. In a clean, dry blender, combine sage, savory, peppercorns, celery salt, and paprika. Blend until coarsely ground. Set aside.
2. Rinse inside of turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Lightly spoon Pear Stuffing into neck and body cavities. Pull neck skin of turkey to back and fasten with a skewer. If a band of skin crosses the tail, tuck the ends of the drumsticks under band. If there is no band, tie drumsticks to the tail using 100-percent-cotton string. Twist wing tips under the back. Place any remaining stuffing in a casserole; cover and chill.
3. Brush turkey with cooking oil. Rub ground herb mixture over entire bird. If desired, loosen skin from breast and rub mixture over meat under breast skin to infuse greater flavor from rub into meat.
4. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of one of the inside thigh muscles. (The thermometer should not touch the bone.) Cover turkey loosely with foil. Roast in a 325 degree F oven for 2-1/4 hours.
5. Cut the band of skin or string between the drumsticks so the thighs will cook evenly. Continue roasting for 3/4 to 1-1/4 hours more or until thermometer registers 180 degree F to 185 degree F and stuffing registers 165 degree F. Uncover the last 30 minutes of roasting. Remove from oven. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes before carving. Bake any remaining stuffing, covered, the last 45 minutes of turkey roasting.
6. Transfer turkey to a serving platter. Pour pan drippings into a large measuring cup, scraping the browned bits into the cup. Skim and reserve fat from drippings. Pour 1/4 cup of the fat into a medium saucepan; discard the remaining fat. Stir in flour. Add enough chicken broth to remaining drippings to make 2 cups.
7. Add dripping mixture all at once to flour mixture in saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. If desired, season to taste with salt and pepper. If desired, garnish serving platter with fall fruits and assorted fresh herbs. Makes 12 to 14 servings.

Ingredients
1  cup chopped celery
1  cup sliced fresh mushrooms or one 4-ounce can sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
1/2  cup chopped onion (1 medium)
1  teaspoon poultry seasoning or ground sage
1/4  teaspoon pepper
1/8  teaspoon salt
8  cups dry bread cubes*
1/2  to 3/4 cup chicken broth or water
1  10- to 12-pound turkey
Cooking oil
1/3  cup margarine or butter
Directions
1. For stuffing, in a medium saucepan cook celery; fresh mushrooms, if using; and onion in margarine or butter until tender but not brown; remove from heat. Stir in poultry seasoning or sage, pepper, and salt. Place dry bread cubes in a large mixing bowl; add onion mixture and, if using, canned mushrooms. Drizzle with enough broth or water to moisten, tossing lightly.
2. Season body cavity of turkey with salt. Spoon some of the stuffing loosely into neck cavity. Pull the neck skin to the back; fasten with a skewer.
3. Lightly spoon more stuffing into the body cavity. (Place any remaining stuffing in a casserole, cover, and chill. Bake stuffing alongside turkey for 30 to 45 minutes or until heated through.) Tuck the ends of the drumsticks under the band of skin across the tail. If the band of skin is not present, tie the drumsticks securely to the tail. Twist wing tips under the back.
4. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Brush with oil. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of one of the inside thigh muscles. The thermometer bulb should not touch the bone. Cover turkey loosely with foil.
5. Roast turkey in a 325 degree F oven for 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 hours or until thermometer registers 180 degrees F. The internal temperature of the stuffing should reach 165 degrees F. After 2-1/2 hours, cut band of skin or string between the drumsticks so thighs will cook evenly. When done, drumsticks should move very easily in their sockets and their thickest parts should feel soft when pressed. Uncover the last 30 minutes of roasting.
6. Remove turkey from oven. Cover; let stand 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Use a spoon to remove stuffing from turkey; place in a serving bowl. Carve turkey. Makes 12 to 14 servings.
*Note: To make dry bread cubes for stuffing, cut bread into 1/2-inch square pieces. (You'll need 12 to 14 slices of bread for 8 cups of dry cubes.) Spread in a single layer in a 15-1/2x10-1/2x2-inch baking pan. Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until dry, stirring twice; cool. (Bread will continue to dry as it cools.) Or, let stand, loosely covered, at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.
Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare stuffing cubes and freeze up to 1 month ahead. (Do not stuff turkey until just before roasting.)

3. Use bread mixture to stuff one 8- to 10-pound turkey. (See stuffing tips and roasting chart for doneness temperatures and roasting times.) Place any remaining stuffing in a 1-quart casserole. (If necessary, to moisten, add more broth to stuffing in casserole.) Cover and chill until ready to bake.
4. Bake stuffing in casserole alongside turkey during the last 35 to 40 minutes of roasting time or until heated through. Or place all of stuffing in a 2-quart casserole. Bake, covered, in a 325 degree F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. Makes 10 to 12 servings.
5. *Note: If desired, substitute 1 to 1-1/3 cups giblet-cooking broth for the chicken broth.
6. Oyster Stuffing: Prepare as above, except omit the giblets and use a medium saucepan. Add 1 pint shucked oysters, drained and chopped, to the cooked vegetables. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Stir in seasonings. Continue as above, except reduce broth to 1/4 cup.
7. Chestnut Stuffing: Prepare as above, except omit the giblets. With a knife, cut an X in the shells of 1 pound fresh chestnuts (3 cups). Spread chestnuts on a large baking sheet. Roast chestnuts in a 400 degree F oven for 15 minutes; cool. Peel and coarsely chop chestnuts. (Or, use one 8-ounce jar or one 10-ounce can whole, peeled chestnuts, drained and chopped.) Add chestnuts with seasonings. Use 3/4 cup to 1 cup broth.

A fall-of-the-bone tender turkey that also makes great vegetables and stock for gravy.
Ingredients
Turkey breast (6-9 lbs.)
Turkey or chicken stock
Olive Oil
Potatoes
Carrots
Celery
Onions
Garlic
Poultry seasoning
Parsley
Salt
Crushed black pepper
Directions
24-hours in advance take thawed turkey and rub a small amount of olive oil over turkey - inside and out.  Next rub salt, pepper, parsley, and poultry seasoning on the inside and out of the turkey.  Place back in refrigerator.
Cut carrots, celery, potatoes, and onion into large pieces.  Place a layer on the bottom of the crock pot.  Pour a small amount of stock on the bottom on the crock pot, enough to cover the bottom to steam the turkey.  Season vegetables with additional seasonings.  Place more vegetables in the cavity of the turkey.  Place turkey in the crock pot and add additional seasoned vegetables around the turkey.
Start cooking the turkey.  For at least an hour leave the temperature setting on high, then change the temperature to low.  Cook for around 8 to 10 hours, depending on the size of the turkey.  Provided you don't open the lid many times basting should not be necessary.  Turkey should be at least 165-degrees internally before consumption.

Ingredients
1 ½ cups cracked wheat kernels
2 ½ cups Samuel Adams Light
½ cup honey or brown sugar
6-7 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons dry yeast
1 ½ cups warm water (110°)
1/3 cup vegetable oil (110°)
2/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup toasted walnuts, coarsely chopped
1 egg white whisked with 1 or 2 tablespoons warmed honey for glaze
Directions
Roast the wheat kernels in a 400° oven, stirring frequently until brown. Combine the wheat kernels in pan with beer and ½ cup of honey. Simmer on low 1 hour, covered. Uncover, raise heat slightly, and simmer an additional hour or until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.
Crush the cooked wheat in a food processor or blender until fine but not pureed. Set aside.
Place 1 cup flour in large mixing bowl. Mix in dry yeast, pour in warm water, and stir thoroughly. Cover and allow to site for 15-20 minutes.
Whisk oil, 2/3 cup honey, salt, walnuts, and cooked wheat into yeast mixture.
Stir in remaining flour one cup at a time using your hands once the dough becomes too heavy for a spatula. Continue adding flour until dough begins to pull away from sides of the blwl and kneading can begin. Knead thoroughly by pushing and turning, adding only enough flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands or surface. When dough is smooth and elastic, coat the inside of large bowl with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Press the ball of dough into the bowl and turn it over, coating the entire surface with oil.
Cover and allow to rise in a warm spot until doubled. When doubled in bulk, punch down, devide in half, and allow to rest 5 minutes, covered.
To shape the dough into loaves, coat an area of the counter with a few drops of oil. Pat the dough into an 8&quot;x10&quot; rectangle.
Starting at the narrow end, roll firmly buy gently into a cylinder. Do not stretch the dough. Pinch ends and turn them under toward the seam side. Slam the dough onto the counter, seam-side down, two or three times to seal and remove large air bubbles.
Place the loaves seam-side down in generously greased loaf pans. Cover and allow to rise until doubled.
Brush with glaze and bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes or until tops are golden and bottoms are brown.

Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
2-oz dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 tsp red food coloring
2/3 cup all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
8-oz cream cheese, room temperature
1/3 cup sugar
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Directions
Preheat oven to 350F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 8 inch metal baking pan. Put a long piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan, letting the parchment extend up two sides of the pan and overhang slightly on both ends. (This will make it easy to remove the bars from the pan after they have baked.) Butter the parchment.
In a small, heatproof bowl, melt butter and chocolate together. Stir until combined and very smooth. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, vanilla extract and red food coloring. Add chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Add flour and salt and stir until just combined and no streaks of dry ingredients remain.
Pour into prepared pan and spread into an even layer.
To prepare cheesecake mixture, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg and vanilla extract in a medium bowl until smooth. Distribute the cheesecake mixture in 8 dollops over batter in the pan. Swirl in with a knife or spatula.
Bake for 35-40 minutes, until brownies and cheesecake are set. A knife inserted into the cheesecake mixture should come out clean and the edges will be lightly browned.
Let cool completely in pan on a cooling rack before lifting out the parchment paper to remove the brownies.

Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies with Fudge Sauce

Ingredients
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg
Fudge Sauce:
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 Tbsp. cocoa powder
Directions
Cream the peanut butter and sugar in a bowl. (This is a hand-stirring job). Beat in the baking powder. Add the egg. Mix until it is all well combined.
The dough will be sticky, so be prepared to get your hands messy. Roll some dough into a ball. (How big? That depends on you. I have found, however, that the smaller these cookies are, the better they hold together. Eat two instead of one!) Roll the ball into white sugar. Line a baking sheet, covered in parchment paper, with sugary balls of dough.
Bake in the oven for about ten minutes. You will know the cookies are done when they feel coherent, but still a little soft. Take the tray out of the oven and let the cookies rest for at least five minutes. Afterwards, carefully transfer them to a cooling rack. After ten minutes or so, they will have hardened and be glistening with sugar.
Once cookies are out of the oven mix fudge sauce ingredients in a microwave-save container.  Microwave for about 1 minute.  Place fudge sauce in a pastry bag and pipe fudge sauce on cookies in a swirl pattern.  Place finished cookies in fridge to set.

Pasta and Veggies
Rating:

Ingredients
1 box of  Penne
2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
1 bag of frozen broccoli (or cauliflower)
salt
pepper
garlic powder
Directions
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add a tad of extra virgin olive oil and then add the bag of frozen veggies. Cook to desired tenderness. The brighter green the veggies, the more nutrients that remain.
A great alternative to boiling the veggies is to steam them. It holds more of the nutrients. If you have a rice cooker with a steam basket, or a steamer, use it.
Bring water to a boil. Add a touch of olive oil to the water and then add pasta once it’s boiling. Cook your pasta to it’s desired tenderness. Being Italian, we like it al dente (to the teeth), not mushy.
After both pasta and veggies are cooked, toss together in a big bowl. Add the 2 tbsp of olive oil, a dash of salt, crushed black pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic if you like that better).
Alternatives: you can toss in cauliflower instead, toss in toasted multi-grain bread cubes for some crunch, or toss in some boiled shrimp for added protein!

Chocolate Multi-grain Mini Loaf
Rating:

Ingredients
2/3 cups whole wheat flour
2/3 cups bread flour
2 Tablespoons Quinoa
2 Tablespoons Oats
1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten (optional)
3 Tablespoons raw sugar or equivalent
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
2/3 cup water
2 Tablespoons cocoa powder (2 Tbsp gives a mild chocolate flavor)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1 Tablespoon Organic olive oil.
1/2 teaspoon salt
Cacao nibs(optional)
Directions
Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to 2 Tablespoons warm water and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Boil the remaining water( about 1/3 cup) and add rinsed quinoa to it. Cook until done, about 10 minutes. All of the water might not be absorbed.
In a blender, blend the quinoa and oats and sugar for a quick pulse to get a coarse mix. You can skip this step and add quinoa and oats directly to the dough to get grainy texture.
In a bowl add whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup bread flour, wheat gluten, cinnamon and salt and mix.
Add in the yeast mixture, oil and oat+quinoa+ sugar/sweetener and mix to combine.
Add 1/3 cup water at a time and Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, scraping sides every 2-3 minutes if using a stand mixer. Add more flour or water in little quantities if needed. Keep the dough soft and not too sticky.
Some fun ways to knead the dough and build gluten!... beat it... yes beat it with a rolling pin, scrape up and beat again, or pound and punch it... or even better, flour your hands well and pick up and throw on the counter.. scrape and reshape every few throws.. in 3-4 minutes, the dough will start to get elastic and less sticky.! gluten!
Spritz the top of dough with some oil spray. Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5 hours.
Punch it lightly. For mini loaf pans, divide dough into 2 parts. Knead and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the other edge under like a jelly roll. You can add some cacao nibs or vegan chocolate chips in it at this point before shaping into a loaf. I dint add any this time.
Place loaf in greased mini bread pans. Spritz the top with water and then spritz a little oil spray, and cover with damp towel.
Place it in a warm place or warm oven for 50 minutes.
Remove towel, spritz top with some water, sprinkle some oats and bake at preheated 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the bread sounds hollow. (35 minutes if baking one bigger loaf).
Remove bread from pan and let cool for an hour.
Slice and enjoy as is!

Winter Hearty Chili
Rating:

Ingredients
1 lb lean ground beef
Small handful of diced onion
1 15 oz can corn
1 15 oz can light or dark kidney beans
1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce
1 green pepper diced
1 package of McCormick's Original Chili Seasoning packet
Directions
Brown the ground beef with the diced onion in a skillet. While that is cooking, pour all the canned items, green pepper, and seasoning packet together in either a crockpot or large soup pot. While some recipes tell you to drain the cans first, DON'T! By doing so, you are letting the yummy juices escape. Pour it all in and not only are you getting more flavor, you are 'stretching' the chili. Once the beef is done, drain and add it to the crockpot/pot.  I would suggest making this in the crockpot and stirring it a few times on low over the course of 2-3 hours.

Ingredients
2 1/2 lbs ground beef
1 pkg cream cheese & chives
1 box jumbo pasta shells
1/2 pkg regular cream cheese
2 jars taco sauce
2 cups crushed tortilla chips
1 teaspoon each salt & chili powder
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3 cups shredded mixed cheese
Garnishes could include: diced tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, etc.
Directions
Cook pasta shells according to package.  Meanwhile, cook beef in large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, stirring to separate meat; drain fat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add cream cheese, salt and chili powder; simmer 5 minutes. Toss shells with butter (so they don't stick to one another) and let cool about 5 minutes so that you can handle them. Fill shells with beef mixture and arrange in a buttered 13x9 inch pan. This is the part where it really helps to have the extra set of hands - it just makes it go quicker plus it's more fun to have help! Pour taco sauce over each shell - be liberal! Cover with foil and bake in a 350 oven for 15 minutes. Uncover, top with cheese and chips and bake an additional 15 more minutes or until bubbly. Serve alongside whatever toppings you wish: tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  We usually serve this with chips & our favorite salsa.  Each person usually eats 4 shells which means this dish makes a solid 7 servings

Cherry Almond Snickerdoodles
Rating:

Ingredients
Topping:
1 cup sugar & 1 tablespoon cinnamon
Cookie Dough:
3 1/2 cups flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon each salt & cinnamon
1 1/2 sticks butter
2 cups sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 eggs
2 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup each dried cherries (cut in half) and sliced almonds
Directions
Mix topping ingredients together and set aside.  Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together and set aside. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Continue to mix, adding eggs, corn syrup and vanilla; mix thoroughly.  Add the dry ingredients, dried cherries and sliced almonds to the bowl and mix until blended.  If the dough is sticky or difficult to handle, wrap and chill the dough for an hour. The dough tends to be pretty crumbly but I have always been able to make it into balls quite easily.
Roll balls of dough (about the size of a walnut) and roll in the cinnamon sugar topping to coat. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 1/2 inches apart. You do not need to press these down until little disks; just leave them as little balls.  Bake for 10-12 minutes (less is better!) in a 375 degree oven until the cookies puff slightly and the surface is slightly cracked. Let cool on a cookie sheet a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool.

1-2 cups mashed potatoes

Garlic salt, salt, and pepper
Olive oil
Directions
In a bowl, mix together the mashed potatoes and egg thoroughly.  Make 3&quot; patties with the mixture and have a thickness of about 1/4&quot; - 1/3&quot;.  On one side, salt and pepper the patties. Flip them over and lightly sprinkle garlic salt and pepper.  Heat up olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, place the patties over the olive oil - that's what makes it brown so nice.  Wait 8 minutes before flipping them. It will feel like a really long 8 minutes the first time ) but if you flip them too early, they will fall apart.  Wait another 6-8 minutes for the other side to become golden brown.
Note: For an extra twist, add some fresh chopped parsley to the mixture before making the patties. It'll brighten the flavor and your plate.

Frozen puff pastry - thaw it before you are ready to cook
1/3 lb sliced deli turkey
1/3 cup apricot preserves
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Directions
Spray a cookie sheet with PAM.  Roll the puff pastry out onto a clean surface. Evenly spread the apricot preserves onto the two puff pastry sheets (you can just use one sheet and half the recipe if you wish).  Next layer the turkey and top with the shredded mozzarella. Carefully roll the puff pastry sheet into a log. Cut the log into about 1/4&quot; slices; you should be able to get about 16 slices out. Spread the pinwheels out onto the cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes at 400 degrees or until golden brown.

Ultimate Pulled Pork
Rating:

Ingredients
2 – 2 ½ lbs pork loin
1 bottle barbecue sauce
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon each Worcestershire & ketchup
1 ½ teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper
Directions
Spray slow cooker with PAM liberally.  The pork loin usually comes split in half. I like to cut mine in half crosswise so that the pulled pieces aren’t so long.  Place the pork down in the crockpot and then mix all the ingredients on top of it.  I actually make this the night before and let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Then turn it on in the morning and cook it for about 6 hours on low.  I've found that it's better not to cook it for longer than 6 hours or you could burn it and no one wants burnt pulled pork.  When it is done, use two forks to pull it apart. Spoon the mixture over it and let it sit for 5 minutes more before serving.

Ingredients for Teriyaki marinade:
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Optional: I have ground ginger in my fridge so I actually used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger & 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic.
Ingredients for complete meal:
1 lb chicken breast, cut into strips
1 20 oz can pineapple tidbits
1/2 cup diced green peppers
2 cups cooked rice, for serving
Directions
Mix all marinade ingredients together in a resealable container. Once mixed, toss in the chicken strips and stir to coat the strips. Place in the fridge and forget about it for a couple hours or a day.  When you are ready to make the meal, heat a skillet to medium heat and add the chicken strips, half a can of the tidbits (use more if you wish or save the other half of the can for a snack), and the green peppers. I would add about 1/2 to 3/4 of the teriyaki marinade into the skillet (see note below). This will provide a nice amount of sauce to go over the rice. Mix the chicken around until all pieces are cooked through (white throughout). Place a mound of rice on your plate and a spoonful of the chicken teriyaki on top.

Cheddar Smashed Potatoes
Rating:

Ingredients
Red or yukon gold potatoes
4 strips bacon, crumbled
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Kraft Zesty Italian dressing
Directions
Scrub potatoes and pat dry on a towel. Using a fork, prick the top of the potato about 5-7 times. If you've had a rough day, feel free to take out the anger on the potato! Place the potatoes in a 9x9 or similar glass baking dish; then add about 1/3&quot; inch of water to the bottom of the dish. Microwave for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, fry off bacon until crispy. Remove bacon and crumble; discard bacon drippings from skillet.
Once the microwave goes off, the real fun begins.  Place one potato on a flat surface and use the bottom of a plate to 'smash' the potato to about 1/2-3/4&quot;.  The potato may break apart a little bit but it will mostly stay intact.
Squirt a tablespoon or so of Zesty Italian dressing into the skillet and allow it to heat up for a minute. Place your smashed potatoes over the dressing and allow to cook for about 4 minutes.
Once browned and cooked on that side, flip it over with a large spatula. You may need to add a small drop or two of dressing under each when you flip it. Once all are flipped, add a small bit of cheese and bacon on top. Cook for 4 minutes on this side and then serve.  You will be surprised at how much flavor the Zesty Italian dressing adds.

Ravioli with Prosciutto & Peas
Rating:

Ingredients
1 bag frozen ravioli
1 cup frozen peas
4 oz prosciutto, cooked until crispy, then chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 small carton whipping cream, contains about 1 cup
1 cup of pasta water
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan
olive oil
Directions
With about a tablespoon of olive oil in a heated skillet, fry the prosciutto.  When crispy (but not burnt), remove the prosciutto and place on a paper towel so that any grease can drain.  When cool, chop until smaller pieces.  In the skillet, add about another tablespoon of olive oil and the garlic.  Allow the garlic to brown in the skillet for 2 minutes.  Next, add the tomato paste and cup of pasta water and stir together for about 1 minute.  Add the whipping cream and stir to mix well.  Your sauce should be a nice salmon cover.  If you want it to be a stronger red sauce, add more tomato paste.  You should continue to stir this mixture on medium heat for 3-5 minutes. It will thicken into a nice sauce. Remember, the longer you have it on the heat, the thicker it will become. If you love sauce like I do, you can add a little bit of chicken stock to stretch the sauce.
As you are making the sauce above, boil a pot of water.  Add the whole bag of frozen ravioli. It only takes about 5 minutes for ravioli to cook. During the last 2 minutes of cooking time, toss in the peas so that they cook. Drain when both are ready.  You should time the ravioli to hit the water at about the same time as the whipping cream goes into the skillet.  This will help make the meal come together at the perfect time!
Once your sauce is to your desired consistency, toss the prosciutto in the pan and stir to coat. Then add the parsley, peas, and ravioli and toss to mix well.  Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top and serve!  I apologize for the long set of instructions but trust me that this meal is pretty simple to make and absolutely delicious. Once you make it once, it will be even more of a cinch to whip together!

Italian Sausage Soup

Ingredients
1 lb ground sausage
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped carrot
1 cup chopped celery
8 cups chicken broth
1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, & oregano
1 8oz can tomato sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
1 bay leaf
1 cup dried orzo pasta or any little pasta
Directions
This recipe calls for a dutch oven; however, if you do not have one, I'd venture to say that you can use a large stockpot but you may want to check it more frequently to stir and make sure ingredients do not stick to the bottom.
In your dutch oven/pot, cook sausage, onion, carrot, and celery over medium heat until sausage is brown. Break up the sausage while cooking so that you have nice bite size pieces instead of a big lump.  Drain well.
Add all other ingredients EXCEPT pasta.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Simmer does not mean that it is boiling - you need to really take it down low. This is the part where those flavors will just meld together and make something unimaginable.  After the hour, add uncooked pasta. Return to a boil and reduce heat. Cook uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf before serving.

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups (12-oz. pkg.) chocolate chips
Icing:  white royal icing and black tube icing (for the letters/numbers)
Directions
Preheat oven to 375.  In a mixer, cream both kinds of sugar and vanilla.  Once creamed, add eggs individually and then the vanilla.  In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add this dry mixture into the mixer until incorporated.  Add chocolate chips and stir in by hand.  Using your hands, smooth out the cookie dough into the bottom of two cookie sheets with sides.  It should be about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot; thick and cover the entire cookie sheet.  Bake for 13-20 minutes, depending on how firm you want them. I would suggest for this project to have the cookies somewhat firm.
Let the cookies cool completely.  Use a pizza cutter to cut the cookies into 1&quot; squares.  Use white icing to individually ice the top of the cookie. Let this firm up and then use the black icing to carefully write the number and letter on the cookie.

Southwestern Steak & Potato Soup
Rating:
4
Ingredients
1 1/2 lbs boneless beef sirloin steak, cut 1 inch thick
3 Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 3/4&quot; pieces
2 cups loose-pack frozen cut green beans
1 small onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 1/2 cups thick and chunky salsa
1 14oz can low sodium beef broth
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
Directions
In a crockpot, mix together salsa, broth, basil and garlic. Trim the fat from meat, cut into 1-inch bite-size pieces and toss in the crockpot. Add in potatoes, green beans and onion.  Mix together to ensure that everything has been coated with the sauce mixture. Mine looked like there wasn't enough juice in there but as things cook, more juices will come out so don't worry!  Put the lid on the crockpot and place on low-heat for 8-10 hours or high-high for 4-5 hours. Stir every now and then if you are home. You'll know it is done when the potatoes and beef are easily speared with a fork. If you are within an hour of it being done and it still doesn't look like enough juice is there, add in some more veggies or beef broth.

Pepperoni Stromboli
Rating:

Ingredients
1 13.6 oz canister of pizza dough
4 oz pepperoni (or a little more if you wish)
1 cup shredded mozzarella (or a little more if you wish)
1/2 cup shredded parmesan
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 jar marinara sauce for serving
Directions
Preheat oven to 400.  Brush a baking sheet lightly with oil; set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 12x10 inch rectangle, about 1/4&quot; thick. I normally do not use a rolling pin because out of the canister it is about this size.  Place the pepperoni over the dough leaving a 1&quot; border around the edges. Top with both cheese.  Brush the edge of the dough with the beaten egg. Starting from the long side, roll the dough into a long cylinder, pressing the edges to seal. Transfer the stromboli to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Cover the stromboli lightly with nonstick aluminum foil to make a tent and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until golden, approximately 15-25 more minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes before slicing into 2-inch pieces. Serve with marinara.

Hamburger Corn and Pea Bake

Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cups frozen corn
1 cup frozen peas
1 pint cream of mushroom soup
1/2 - 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 - 3/4 cup milk
1 1/2 cups egg noodles
1/2 cup torn up bread or crusty bread
1 Tablespoon butter, melted
Salt and pepper to taste
Directions
Bring a pot of water to a boil, salt it, and cook the noodles. I used some remaining store-bought egg noodles that I needed to use up, plus some homemade soaked whole wheat noodles.
Meanwhile, cook the meat with onion until done. Stir in corn, peas, soup, cheese, and milk. I use homemade cream of mushroom soup. If you don't have homemade, you could use organic if you'd like, or else just add some extra milk, arrowroot powder, and your favorite seasonings. Mix well. Stir in noodles.
Put in 2 qt. casserole dish. Mix bread and butter. Sprinkle on top. (I forgot the bread was supposed to go on top and I stirred it up in the mixture. Oops. I used crusty bread (like you'd use for stuffing) and it turned out really tasty.)
Bake at 350 for 45 min. - 1 hr., until hot and bubbly. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.

Herb-Focaccia Chestnut & Cranberry Dressing
Servings:

Rating:

Ingredients
12 cups Whole Wheat Herb-Focaccia, cut into 1&quot; cubes and dried
4 1/2 cup vegetable stock
1/4 cup vegan chicken flavored seasoning, optional
1 large leek, white and light green parts only, diced and washed
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 1/2-2 cups diced celery, about 3 large stalks
1 1/2 tbsp minced fresh thyme
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp minced fresh rosemary leaves
2 tsp minced fresh sage leaves
1/2 tsp poultry seasoning
1 large granny smith apple, peeled and diced
1 cup chopped, peeled roasted chestnuts
1 cup dried cranberries
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and black pepper to taste
Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a small sauce pan, heat vegetable stock just to a simmer and whisk in vegan chicken flavored seasoning.  Remove from heat and set aside.
Add focaccia croutons to a large bowl and set aside.
Heat a large saute pan on medium-low and add olive oil, leeks, onions, celery, garlic, thyme, sage, rosemary, poultry seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste and saute for about 7-10 minutes until soft.  Add diced apples and cook about 3 minutes longer. Turn off heat and let cool to room temperature.
Add leek-onion-celery mixture to croutons, along with cranberries and chopped chestnuts and stir well to combine.  Add two cups of vegetable stock and stir well.  Let sit for a minute or so before adding another 1 cup of stock and stir well.  Repeat adding about 1/2 cup of stock at a time until the croutons are soft, but still hold their shape.  You want them to be moist, but not mushy or dry.  Because my croutons are made with whole wheat, they are denser and I used the entire 4-1/2 cups veg stock.  If you purchase store-bought croutons or use white bread you may use less veg stock.
Check for seasonings and add salt and pepper to taste if needed.  Butter a 12x9 or similar size casserole dish with Earth Balance and spoon dressing into dish and distributing evenly. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, rotate the dish and bake another 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
Serve immediately.

1/2 cup old-fashioned oats, finely ground
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
2 to 3 tablespoons very cold water
Directions
COMBINE flour, ground oats, sugar and salt in medium bowl. Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle with water; blend together with a fork until mixture holds together.
SHAPE dough into ball; place on lightly floured sheet of wax paper. Top with additional piece of wax paper. Roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Remove top sheet of wax paper and invert dough into 9-inch deep-dish (4-cup volume) pie plate. Slowly peel away wax paper. Trim excess crust. Turn edge under; crimp as desired.
TIPS:
• Substitute whole-wheat pastry flour for a finer textured, flakier pie crust.
• Oats can be finely ground in a food processor or blender.
• This whole-grain pie crust is great with LIBBY'S® Famous or Lighter LIBBY'S® Pumpkin Pie filling found on VeryBestBaking.com. No need to prebake the crust. Just substitute this crust for the deep-dish pie shell called for in the recipe. Follow the temperatures and bake times stated in the recipe.
• To make two crusts, double all ingredients, follow procedure above and divide dough in half.
• If a prebaked crust is needed for your recipe, preheat oven to 400º F. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cool completely on wire rack.

4 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
12 ounces shiitake mushrooms, (substitute cremini if preferred), stemmed and sliced
Freshly ground pepper and salt, to taste
4 small sprigs fresh rosemary, plus 1/2 teaspoon crushed
2 teaspoons Kikkoman Soy Sauce
4 boneless rib-eye, or sirloin tip steaks, about 1-1/4&quot; thick
1 ounce cognac or Scotch, optional
5 ounces Signature Sauce (scant 2/3 cup)
Directions
SIGNATURE SAUCE
Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil, shallots and garlic and sautè until translucent, but not browned. Add tomato paste and sizzle 30 seconds. Add 1/4 cup soy sauce, remaining ingredients, and 2/3 cup water. Simmer uncovered on low heat 10 minutes. Strain. Return to pan; cook over medium-high heat until reduced to 1-1/4 cups, about 8 minutes.
Add remaining soy sauce. Simmer 5 minutes or until silky, with the consistency of a light syrup. Add more pepper to taste if desired. Keep warm until ready to use, or refrigerate 2-3 days. Makes about 1-1/4 cups, or enough for 8-10 average servings, or 2-3 entrees.
APPLICATION RECIPE
Heat 2 tablespoons oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter in a wide sautè pan over medium-high heat. Add shiitakes, a pinch of salt, freshly ground pepper to taste, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary and sautè until they give up their liquid. Add soy sauce, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until concentrated and silky, 10-12 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Season steaks generously with pepper. Heat a heavy non-stick fry pan (or the rinsed out sautè pan) over medium-high heat. Film with remaining oil. When hot, sear steaks on one side until browned. Turn, sear 2 minutes, and cook until 125°F. for rare, 135°F. for medium-rare, or to desired doneness. Remove with tongs to plates or platter. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. If using, add cognac to pan and evaporate over medium heat (if heat is too high it will flame - this is not a problem just be aware). Add 1 tablespoon water and the Signature Sauce. Bring to low boil scraping up caramelized meat juices from pan. Whisk in remaining butter. Adjust pepper to taste.
Drizzle each steak with 2 tablespoons sauce, top with shiitake confit. Dot plate rims with a little more sauce if desired. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
Wine suggestion: Merlot or the same wine you used for the sauce.
Additional serving suggestions: Buttered steamed baby potatoes.
ADDITIONAL USAGE IDEAS
Use as marinade for thick tuna steaks (preferably the deep red variety), or salmon before grilling. Marinate up to 2 hours, no longer. Discard marinade or bring to boil and use as sauce.
Use to deglaze the roasting pan from a standing rib roast, and as sauce for the sliced beef. Add a few tablespoons of water for deglazing with the sauce.
Braised Root Vegetables: toss with a medley of root vegetables and braise slowly. (Carrots, turnips, Jerusalem artichokes, daikon radish, are good candidates).

Mustard-Crusted Salmon
Rating:
0
Ingredients
6-inch piece of baguette, crusts removed and torn into rough chunks.
2 boneless salmon filets, about 6 ounces each
s&p
1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for the salmon
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp whole grain Dijon mustard
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped
1 tsp vegetable oil
Directions
Preheat the broiler to high and adjust rack to 6 inches below the element (we used the broiler in our toaster oven).  Pulse bread in the bowl of a food processor until coarse crumbs are created.  Season the salmon with s&p.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp butter, mustard, and thyme.  Using a fork, stir and mash the mixture together until the butter is incorporated. Season with s&p.
Spread the skin of each fillet of salmon with a thin layer of butter.  Season with salt.  Heat a medium broiler-safe skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.  Add 1 tsp vegetable oil.  Add salmon buttered-side down and cook without moving until the skin is nice and crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Pile the crumbs on the salmon, then transfer to the broiler.   Broil until the crumbs are crunchy and browned, 3-4 minutes.  Watch the salmon to make sure the bread crumbs don't burn.
Serve immediately.

Rugelach
Rating:
4
Ingredients
Dough:
3 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
2 Tbsp sugar
1/2 lb cold butter, cut into tablespoon-sized cubes
1 cup sour cream
1 tsp vanilla
Filling:
1 1/3 cups apricot jam
1 1/3 cups finely-chopped walnuts
1/4 cup cinnamon-sugar (1/4 cup sugar mixed with 2-3 tsp cinnamon)
Directions
In a bowl or a food processor, mix together the flour, salt and sugar until combined. Add the butter, and pulse in the food processor or cut with a pastry cutter (or two knives) until it is reduced to bits that are about half the size of a pea. If using a food processor, dump the contents into a bowl at this point. Stir the vanilla into the sour cream. Using a spoon, and then your hands when needed, knead the sour cream and vanilla into the flour mixture until it is well incorporated, and the dough holds together when you squeeze it. Stop as soon as this is possible — do not over-mix. Shape the dough into four chubby disks, cover with plastic and allow to relax in the refrigerator for at least one hour (overnight is fine too).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and line two cookie sheets with parchment or liners (very important, as the molten jam tends to solder them to a pan).
Take a disk of dough out of the refrigerator, and place on a floured countertop or pastry mat. Roll out to a 12" circle, trimming off the ends if needed. This dough is much softer than a traditional pastry crust, so you shouldn't need to let it warm up before rolling. Spread 1/3 cup apricot jam over the round of dough, and sprinkle with 1/3 cup nuts and 1 Tbsp cinnamon-sugar. Taking a chef's knife or pizza cutter, divide the dough evenly into 16 wedges. Starting from the wide base of each wedge, roll towards the center to form a crescent. Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment or silicone liner, making sure that the tip of the crescent is pinned underneath to prevent the cookie from unrolling. Bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is just beginning to color, about 30 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool, being careful of the hot jam. Best enjoyed the day they are made (any leftovers are best kept in the freezer).

Roasted Rhubarb with Creme Fraiche Semifreddo
Servings:
6
Rating:
2
Ingredients
Semifreddo:
3 large eggs, separated
2/3 cup sugar, separated
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 vanilla bean
1/4 cup creme fraiche (can be omitted if you don't have, or increased for a more pronounced flavor, but this small amount works quite well)
Roasted Rhubarb:
1 lb rhubarb, cut in 2" lengths
1/4 cup white wine
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 vanilla bean (from making semifreddo)
Directions
Line a 9" loaf pan with plastic wrap or parchment (if using plastic wrap, you can try to smooth out any wrinkles that will imprint themselves on the finished semifreddo, but I usually fail at that task). Set aside.
Place the egg whites in the bowl of a large mixer, and beat, gradually increasing the speed to high and sprinkling in 1/3 cup of the sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form, then transfer to another bowl (it can be a small one) and set aside.
Add the cream to the mixing bowl, and beat on medium until stiff peaks form. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.
Place the reserved egg yolks in the mixing bowl, and add the seeds scraped from the vanilla bean (reserve the pod for the roasted rhubarb), vanilla extract, and reserved sugar. Beat until the mixture has lightened in color and thickened and doubled in volume, ~3 minutes. Whisk in the creme fraiche until it is just combined.
Take the yolk mixture, and gently fold it into the bowl of whipped cream. Add the beaten egg whites, and fold in in a few additions, until there are no streaks left, taking care not to deflate the mixture. Pour it into the prepared loaf pan, and place in the freezer. Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours.
When the semifreddo is ready, prepare the roasted rhubarb.
Preheat the oven to 350. Place the rhubarb, wine, sugar, and left-over half of the vanilla bean in an oven-proof pan (I used an 8" square casserole dish, which worked perfectly). Stir to evenly distribute ingredients. Place the pan in the oven and bake for about half an hour, turning the rhubarb once (gently!), until the rhubarb is totally tender but hasn't lost its shape. Remove from the oven, and let cool slightly (or fully, depending upon your taste). Discard the vanilla bean.
To serve, cut thick slices of the semifreddo, and serve topped with the roasted rhubarb and its syrupy juices.

Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar until they are light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla until the mixture is smooth.
Gradually stir in the dry ingredients.
Place the dough onto a lightly floured cutting board, and form into a ball. Divide the dough in half and form each piece into a thick disk, smoothing the edges. Place in a zippered plastic bag and refrigerate for a minimum of two hours or for up to two days.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Remove one disk from the refrigerator and let stand for five minutes on a lightly floured cutting board. Cover cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Roll the disk a few times with a rolling pin to soften.  Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 of an inch, turning it over and dusting it and the board lightly with flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking.
Use your favorite Christmas cookie cutters to cut out your cookies.
Transfer the cookie cut-outs to the baking sheet. They should be spaced 1 inch apart. Form the dough scraps into a ball, re-roll and cut into additional cookies. Repeat until all the dough is used.
Bake the cookies until firm. They should be uncolored on the top and lightly browned on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks and let cool. Repeat with the second disk of dough.
To make the icing, using a fine-mesh sieve, sift the 1 ½ cups confectioners’ sugar into a bowl. Add the milk and stir until smooth. Add more sifted sugar or milk as needed until the icing is spreadable. Divide the icing into several separate bowls. Stir in holiday colored food coloring into each bowl, until a rich, deep color is achieved.  Put the icing into a decorating bottle or a pastry bag.
Squeeze the pastry bag or decorating bottle until the tip is full. Holding the tip at a 45 degree angle, squeeze to pipe the icing. Form an outline around the cookie, and then use a spatula to fill in the icing. While the icing is moist, sprinkle with colored sugars.

Italian Wedding Soup
Rating:
5
Ingredients
1 lb 1-inch turkey meatballs (we got ours from the farmers' market but you can make them yourself with whatever combination of grated cheese, bread crumbs, garlic and herbs you want)
3 tbsp evoo, divided
1 medium yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups chicken stock
1 bunch escarole, trimmed and torn into bite-sized pieces (about 6 lightly packed cups)
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated
s&p
Directions
In large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tbsp evoo over moderately high heat.  Add the meatballs in batches, and cook, turning, until browned on the outside all over, 3 to 5 minutes.  You don't need to cook them all the way through because they will cook more in the soup.  Remove meatballs from the pan and set aside.
In a large heavy soup pot, heat the remaining 1 tbsp evoo over moderate heat.  Add the onion saute, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes.  Add garlic and saute until onions are tender and garlic is soft, but not browned, about 2 additional minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Add the escarole and the orzo, reduce heat to simmer for 6 minutes.  Add the meatballs and cook another 4 minutes.
Slow pour the lightly beaten egg into hot soup, stirring constantly.  Stir in Parm-Reg.  Simmer just until egg bits are set, about 1-2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
Serve with bread and additional Parm-Reg for garnish.

Garlicky Sesame-Cured Broccoli Salad
Servings:
4
Rating:
3
Ingredients
2 tsp vinegar of your choosing (Clark recommends red wine, we used a mix of rice wine and balsamic)
1 tsp coarse salt
2 lbs broccoli crowns (~2 large heads), washed and broken into small florets
1/3 cup olive oil
4 large cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp cumin seeds
2 tsp toasted sesame oil
large pinch crushed red chile flakes
Directions
In a large bowl, mix together the vinegar and salt. Add the broccoli, and toss to combine. Set aside.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add the garlic and cumin seeds, and cook until fragrant (it should only take a minute). Add the sesame oil and chile flakes. Turn off the heat, and pour the hot mixture over the broccoli, tossing well so that the hot oil coats everything. Let sit for at least an hour, for the broccoli to soften and the flavors to develop. Taste before serving and adjust seasonings if needed.

Dover Sole Almondine with Brussels Sprouts
Rating:
5
Ingredients
2 tbsp vegetable oil, separated
10 oz shredded Brussels Sprouts (we used our mandoline, but you can buy them preshredded at Trader Joe's)
2 Dover sole fillets (ours weighed about 3 oz each)
all-purpose flour
2 tbsp unsalted butter, separated
2 tbsp sliced almonds
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
2 tsp white wine
Directions
Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and swirl to coat. Add Brussels sprouts and season lightly with s&p. Saute, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a warm platter and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.
While the Brussels sprouts are sauteing, pat fish dry and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Lightly dredge filets in flour, knocking off any excess. Set aside.
Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 tbsp vegetable oil and 1 tbsp butter. Wait until foam subsides before adding the fish. Cook fish, flipping carefully once, until browned and just cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes total. Add fish to platter with Brussels sprouts.
Reduce heat to medium-low. If a lot of oil/butter remains in the pan, discard all but 1 tbsp. Add almonds and remaining 1 tbsp butter and cook, stirring, until almonds and butter are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and white wine. Season with s&p. Spoon almond mixture over fish and Brussels sprouts.
Serve.

Ajam Seitan (Devilled Chicken)
Rating:
3
Ingredients
3 deboned organic chicken thighs
Salt
1 tbsp mustard
1/2 lemon
2 small onions
2 cloves garlic
1 tsp sambal oelek (or chilli paste)
4 tbsp (stir fry) oil
3 tbsp ketjap manis (or regular soy sauce plus a pinch of sugar)
Directions
Season the chicken thighs with salt and thoroughly coat with the mustard. Roll them up again and keep covered in the fridge until ready to use.
Juice the lemon. Peel the onions and garlic and slice the onion finely. Mince the garlic.
Mix the onion, garlic, lemon juice and sambal thoroughly.
Heat 3 tbsp oil in a frying pan and brown the chicken thighs on all sides for about 4 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove the chicken from the pan, add 1 tbsp oil and fry the onion-sambal mix over a low heat until the onion is tinged yellow.  Add the chicken back to the pan, along with the ketjap manis and 1 tbsp water, and bake the chicken for 12 minutes over a low heat until cooked (turning regularly and basting with the sauce). Most of the juices of the sauce should have evaporated by the end of the cooking time.
Serve the chicken with the onion sauce spooned over it. Serve yellow rice (rice with 1 tsp of turmeric added to the cooking water) and cucumber salad on the side.

Corn, Cherry Tomato and Basil Pizza
Rating:
1
Ingredients
1 ball of pizza dough, ~10 oz
semolina or regular flour for dusting
1/4-1/3 lb mozarella, shredded
kernels shaved off 1 ear of corn
2 dozen small cherry tomatoes (preferably Sungold), sliced in half
olive oil
coarse salt
1 handful basil leaves, torn if large
Directions
Preheat your oven, with a pizza stone if you have, to 500 degrees for an hour. If your pizza dough has been refrigerated, let it come to room temperature for an hour.
Place the pizza dough on a lightly-floured counter top, and press outward into a thick disk (leaving a 1" unpressed area along the edge as the crust). Pick up the disk and let it drape over the backs of your hands, letting gravity help you stretch it into a 12-14" circle. If the dough resists, let it relax for a few minutes, then try again. Place the stretched dough on a peel (or overturned cookie sheet or cutting board) that's lightly dusted with semolina or other type of flour.
Scatter the mozzarella on top of the dough, then the corn and tomatoes. Drizzle the whole pizza with a small amount of olive oil, and a sprinkling of salt. Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone in your oven, and bake ~7-10 minutes, until the crust browns and the cheese melts.
Remove the pizza from the oven, and let cool for a moment (if you're making one pizza, you can leave it on the stone, otherwise I like to transfer to a rack, or just slide a knife or such between the peel/cutting board and the pie, to let the steam vent so it doesn't soften itself). Transfer to a cutting board if you haven't already, and scatter on the basil. Slice and serve.

North African Oven Fries
Rating:
0
Ingredients
2 teaspoons sweet paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
~3 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons harissa, or your favorite hot sauce (optional)
6 large waxy potatoes (or more smaller ones), scrubbed but not peeled
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
Directions
Preheat the oven at 400° Fahrenheit.
While the oven is preheating, mix the paprka, cumin, olive oil and harissa together in a large bowl. Peel the potatoes, and slice into wedges or fries, and add them to the bowl. Toss to coat the potato wedges with the oil and seasoning, and a generous sprinkle of salt.
Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet in a single layer, and bake until golden brown and crisp on the outside, about 25-30 minutes (depending upon how thick you've cut them), turning once.
While the potatoes are cooking, place the cilantro, lemon juice, and garlic in a bowl (you can re-use the same bowl you used earlier). When the potatoes are baked, tip them into the bowl, and toss to coat. The hot potatoes will temper the garlic, and everything should smell amazing. Taste, add additional salt or harissa as needed, and serve.

Rating:

A traditional American comfort food which will certainly please all.  Pairs well with nearly all meats and vegetables.
Ingredients
4 large russet potatoes, about a pound each
Olive oil
1/2 cup milk
2 Tbsp butter, softened
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
4 strips bacon
Directions
1.  Bake the potatoes. Preheat the oven to 400F. Scrub the potatoes clean under running water. Poke each potato in several places with the tines of a fork so that when the potatoes are cooking they don't explode. Rub the potatoes all over with a little olive oil. Place directly on the middle or top rack of the oven. Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through. They should give a little when pressed.
2.  While the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Let cool. Crumble.
3.  Allow the potatoes to cool to touch. Slice the top third lengthwise off the potato. Use a spoon to scoop out the insides, forming a potato &quot;canoe&quot;, leaving about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.
4.  Place the scooped out potato insides, sour cream, milk, cream, and butter into a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher. If you want a creamy texture, beat with an electric beater until desired consistency.
5.  Mix in the extras with the potatoes. Reserve some of the extras to sprinkle on the tops of the potatoes. Spoon fillings into the potato shells. Sprinkle with extra toppings.
6.  Heat oven to 350°F. Place potatoes on a roasting pan and bake 15 to 20 minutes until heated through.

Borek with Greens and Feta
Rating:
0
Ingredients
Dough
1/2 cup warm milk
1/4 cup plus 1 Tbsp warm water
1 3/4 tsp active yeast
2 cups flour (you can swap out half whole wheat flour--just add an additional Tbsp water)
3/4 tsp salt
Filling
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 bunch Russian or lacinato kale, washed and finely chopped
salt
1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed and finely chopped
3/4 cup feta
To finish:
2-3 Tbsp melted butter or olive oil
1 egg, beaten
1 Tbsp sesame seeds
Directions
To make the dough: Pour the water and milk in a mixing bowl, sprinkle on the yeast, and allow to soften for a few minutes. Add the flour and salt, kneading with your hands or a dough hook for several minutes until you create a soft, pliable dough that just clears the sides of the bowl (if it doesn't, add a touch more flour). Cover and let sit for a few minutes while you prepare the filling.
To make the filling: Heat the oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add the kale and stir to coat with the oil, and sprinkle with a very light dusting of salt to draw water out. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is softened. Add the parsley, and cook an additional minute. Remove from heat and stir in the crumbled feta.
To assemble and bake: Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll out the first piece to form a large rectangle, ~15"x17". Drizzle it with the melted butter or olive oil, and then scatter half the filling evenly over the top. Roll out the second piece of dough, lay it on top of the first, and repeat the process with melted butter and the remaining filling. Roll out the final piece of dough, lay it over the top, and drizzle with the remaining butter.
Fold the right- and left-hand sides in, so that they meet in the middle (you can consult the pictorial on
this
page, which gives you a better idea of the whole process). Repeat with the top and bottom, so you have a nicely folded package. Flip it upside-down, so the smooth underside is on top. Roll it gently with a rolling pin, taking care to not tear the dough while you ease it into a roughly 8" square. If you have parchment paper, place the borek on a large square of it. With a large knife, cut through all the layers halfway through each side and on the diagonal, yielding 8 little triangles. Pick up the parchment, and transfer the cut square into an 8" brownie pan (if you don't have parchment, just make sure your pan is well-greased). Cover lightly with a clean dishtowel, and let rise for about 1 hour.
When the dough is almost done rising, preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Gently brush the dough with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Place in the oven and bake until lightly browned, ~30-45 minutes. Let cool and serve.

Ingredients
20 small burger buns or English muffins, halved
40 oz ground beef
4 bottles Samuel Adams Boston Lager
sliced pickles
40 slices American cheese, cut in 1 inch x 1 inch pieces
20 tomato skewers
Directions
To make the ketchup: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, stir together the ketchup, mayonnaise, and lager. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. The ketchup will keep for up to 1 week.
To make the sliders: Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large mixing bowl, mix the ground beef with the lager. Scoop half of the bread from the bottom portion of the buns or English muffins. Press ground beef into the scooped out part of the bread and press the meat gently to fill the indentation and to mound it slightly. Lay the filled bun halves, meat sides down, on a baking sheet. Bake for about 3 minutes, just to brown the meat lightly. Remove the pan from the oven and turn the buns over. Top each with a slice of cheese, a few pickles and the top of the bun. Put the sliders on the baking sheet and return to the oven for about 5 minutes or until the meat is cooked to the desired degree of doneness. Skewer each of the tomatoes with a sturdy plastic or wooden skewer or toothpick and insert each skewer in the top of the slider. Serve the sliders with the ketchup.

Samuel Adams Boston Lager Infused Pizza Dough
Prep Time:
15 minutes
Servings:
2 crusts
Rating:
1
Ingredients
Approx. 3 1/2 cups (20 oz.) unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for dusting
1 packet instant yeast aka: highly active or bread machine yeast
1 Tablespoon finely granulated salt
1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil plus more for your rising container, cookie sheet, pizza pan or screen
12oz. bottle of Samuel Adams Boston Lager® warmed up to 120°F-130°F
Directions
Preheat: Oven to 500°F
Warm the beer to 120°F-130°F (warming the beer properly means your yeast will activate properly). Warm the (open) bottle in a bowl of very warm (not boiling water) or by running it under hot water from the tap. A thermometer insures success - if you don't have one handy, the beer should feel very warm (not too hot) to the touch. In a 5 quart or larger bowl, combine flour, yeast, salt and oil. Add beer to flour mixture, and stir with a fork (not stirring with your hands just yet - it's too sticky at first) until the dough is lumpy. Then, go in with your hands. The dough will still be a little sticky, so gradually add flour as you knead to the point that the finished dough should be just slightly tacky and elastic. To tell when the dough is done, periodically poke it and when the dough gently springs back, it's done. Don't worry if it's not perfectly smooth - don't over knead it! Kneading: press down, push, fold, repeat. Your finished dough, will weigh right around 2 pounds (30-34 oz.). Break into two equal pieces - use a scale or eyeball it. Create a ball of each piece and place them in separate airtight containers lightly greased with olive oil. Each container needs to be at least a quart in size to allow for the dough to double in size (deli quart containers work great for this). Set dough aside to rise in a warm location, about 70°F-80F is good. After dough has expanded/up to doubling in size (about 1-2 hours), gently remove from container and stretch to fit on a lightly greased 12&quot; or 14&quot; cookie sheet, pizza pan or screen. Dress to your liking and bake in a 500°F preheated oven until your crust and toppings are to your desired doneness (about 10 to 15 minutes). Out of the oven, allow a few minutes to cool. Then cut, serve and enjoy.
For a thicker crust, stretch to 12&quot;. For a thinner crust, stretch to 14&quot;
Prep time: 15 minutes
Rise time: Between 1-2 hours in a warm spot (about 70°F-80°F)
10-15 minutes depending on your oven, toppings and desired doneness

Turn turkey breast side down. Fill neck cavity lightly with 1 cup of the stuffing (do not pack stuffing because it will expand during roasting). Fasten neck skin of turkey to back with skewer.
Turn turkey breast side up. Fold wings across back of turkey so tips are touching. Fill body cavity lightly with 3 cups of the stuffing (do not pack stuffing because it will expand during roasting). Place remaining stuffing in baking dish. Cover with foil; refrigerate until ready to bake. Tuck legs under band of skin at tail (if present), or tie together with heavy string.

Beef Stew
Rating:
3
Ingredients
Vegetable oil, for searing
2.0  pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 medium onion
3 cloves garlic, crushed
6 teaspoons all-purpose flour
3 cups beef broth
2 sprigs parsley & 1 sprig fresh thyme
6 small red potatoes
2.5 cups baby carrots
1 cup peas
Directions
Step 1
: Wash and slice the veggies. I used red potatoes, but any should do – yukon gold, russet, fingerlings, whatever you have on hand. This stew doesn’t judge. Give em a good scrubbing, peel (I like keeping the skin on when I use reds) and slice into hearty chunks and set aside.
I used baby carrots but you’re more than welcome to use grown up carrots too. Short cuts are ok every now and then. I have no idea why these look radioactive orange here.
Typically, beef stew calls for celery but I’m not a big fan of those, so I substituted them with peas. I don’t know what it is about celery but even slathering them in peanut butter can’t make a believer outta me. However, if you love celery in your stews, knock yourself out!
Step 2
: Chop the aromatics and herbs. Snip off parsley leaves, give them a rough chop then set aside. Leave the rosemary as is. I used 2 sprigs but next time I’ll use just one. Using 2 was a bit too ‘herb-y’ for me.
Slice the onion into big chunks.
Crush the garlic cloves and give em a rough chop.
Step 3
: Take the meat out, wash and slice into cubes. Or, you can do like me and let the cute butcher at Whole Foods cube them up for you.
Step 4
: Take out a frying pan, drizzle a little bit of oil and heat on medium-high.  Season the beef with salt and pepper while you wait. When the oil is heated, add the meat cubes. Then Don’t. touch. them. Let them sizzle, let them sit and get seared into that golden brown crazy goodness.
This should be about 3-4 minutes. With a pair of tongs, flip the cubes on to the other side and repeat. When all sides are browned, remove the meat from the pan and set them on a plate. Turn the heat down to medium.
Step 5
: Add the onions and garlic. Fry them in the leftover oil from the meat. Yes, I just said leftover oil.
Step 6
: Keep frying until the onions are soft then turn the heat down to medium low. Watch out for the garlic and make sure it doesn’t burn. Burnt garlic transcends through everything. You can’t mask it. Trust me, I’ve tried.
Don’t worry if you have brown flecks of meat sticking to the bottom of your pan. We’ll lift those up when we make the sauce. It makes the stew taste unbelievable.
Step 7
: Add the flour then add the beef broth. You can also use chicken, or vegetable broth. Stir until everything melds into a creamy gravy. Season with salt and pepper. Taste and taste again.
You’ll find the brown crisps will scrape off and lift off easily into the sauce. Taste it one last time and think about making this into a gravy for the mashed potatoes. Hmm next time.
I placed all the veggies into a slow cooker because I still need to get a deep stew pot. Silly me only brought a frying pan and a sauce pan when I moved. What was I thinking?
Two things: First, you can do this on a stove. Set the dial to low and let the meat cook slow  in a deep pot for 6 or more hours. The slow heat breaks down the collagen in between the meat fibers – that really makes for that soft and melt in your mouth beef.
Second. Don’t add the veggies with the meat like I did here. At the start of cook time, you should only have the meat, stock (with garlic and onions) and herbs. When I checked half way through the cook time, the veggies had already finished cooking while the meat was still half way done. I had to spoon out the veggies and put them aside until the meat was finished cooking.
Add the veggies halfway during the cooking time. Add the peas last. When I say last, I mean when you’ve turned off the stove and are ready to serve. They cook in no time and you want to avoid turning them brown.
Finally, taste it. Salt more if needed and serve.

Mac anc Cheese with Tomato and Squash
Rating:

Ingredients
4 tablespoons butter, plus more for baking dish
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
2 tablespoons minced onion
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning
3/4 tablespoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 cups milk
(I added 1 1/2 cups pureed fall squash)
3 cups shredded Cheddar, divided
2 ripe tomatoes, blanched, peeled, and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
Freshly ground black pepper
Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking dish.
Bring 6 cups of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan, over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring constantly, until tender. Add the flour, salt, dry mustard, and paprika; mix well. Stir in the milk and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. (Add pureed squash here.) Add 2 cups of the shredded cheese and stir until melted. Toss in the macaroni and pour into the prepared dish. Cover the macaroni with tomato slices and season salt and pepper, to taste. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. The last few minutes, top with the remaining cheese and return to the oven until the cheese melts. (I didn't think this step was necessary, so I skipped it.) Serve hot.

Szechuan Beans
Rating:
3
Ingredients
1 pound green beans, washed, topped, and tailed
1 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil
1 tablespoon whole peppercorns, preferably Szechuan
1 (1-inch) knob ginger, sliced into coins
2 garlic cloves, sliced
Directions
Line several baking sheets with dish towels and set aside. Prepare and ice-water bath in a large bowl or clean sink.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop the beans into the water, no more than 1 pound at a time, and return to a boil. Blanch for 1 minute.
Scoop the beans out with a spider or slotted spoon and plunge them into the ice-water bath. Continue blanching in batches. Remove the beans from the ice bath with a slotted spoon and spread on the towel-covered baking sheets. Blot dry.
To make the pickled, pack the beans vertically in a quart jar.
Combine the vinegar, water, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, peppercorns, ginger, and garlic in a medium nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute. Pour the hot brine over the beans to cover by 1/2 inch. Leave 1/2 inch of headspace between the top of the liquid and the lid.
Cool, cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

The persimmon smash takes my new best friends and cooks them down into an essence-of-persimmon syrup, perked up with a bit of citrus.
Ingredients
Persimmon Syrup
3
fuyu persimmons
, peeled and chopped  (you can make this without peeling, but it yields a smoother puree)
2 cups water
3/4 cup sugar
Finished Drink
2 ounces whiskey
2 ounces
persimmon syrup
3/4 ounce
lemon juice
1/2 ounce
orange juice
sprig of
mint
, for garnish (I decided to go with rosemary, rather than brave the rain and harvest some neighborhood mint, but mint really is best)
Directions
To Make Persimmon Syrup:
Place the persimmons, water and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat until it's just high enough to maintain a simmer. Cook until the persimmons have softened and the liquid has thickened slightly, ~15 minutes. Cool, then puree in a blender. Chill.
To Make Cocktail:
In a cocktail shaker (or, as it's known in this house, canning jar), combine the persimmon syrup, whiskey,  lemon juice, and orange juice with a bit of ice. Shake well, taste to adjust as needed, and strain (or, if we're being honest, pour) into a cocktail glass with ice. Garnish with a sprig of mint.

Summer Corn Salad
Rating:
2
The crunch of the corn, the snap of balsamic, and fresh basil just ties this salad up into a cute little bow.
Ingredients
8 fresh corn ears
1 red onion
2 yellow squash
1 red bell pepper
2 medium tomatoes
1/2 cup olive oil
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
12 basil leaves
1 tsp. kosher salt
2 garlic cloves
Directions
Step 1: Fill a deep pot with water and heat to boiling. In the meantime, strip the husks off the corn and give them a good rinse under water. When the water is boiling, add the corn and let them cook for 15 minutes. We’re cooking them for a short time because we want the corn kernels to stay crisp!
Step 2: While the corn is cooking, roughly chop the onion, squash, and bell pepper. Chop these up to match the size of corn kernels. Chiffonade the basil leaves (stack the leaves on top of each other, roll tightly, and slice across)
Step 3: When the corn is done cooking, run them under cold water to cool quickly then put them aside.
Step 4: In the meantime, prepare the dressing: In a bowl, add the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Whisk, whisk, whisk, until combined. Add the basil leaves and salt then whisk again. Set aside.
Step 5: When the corn has cooled, scrape the corn kernels off the cob with a sharp knife and place into a huge mixing bowl. Add the rest of the chopped ingredients and pour the dressing on top. Stir until evenly combined. Done!
Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving. You can definitely make this recipe ahead of time; I’d recommend a few hours before the party, not the night before.

Chocolate Macarons
Rating:
1
Ingredients
Batter:
1 cup (100 grams) powdered sugar
½ cup almond flour (50 grams)
3 tablespoons (25 grams) unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
2 large egg whites, at room temperature
5 tablespoons (65 grams) granulated sugar
Ganache:
½ cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons light corn syrup (optional)
4 ounces (120 grams) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 tablespoon (15 grams) butter, cut into small pieces
Directions
Preheat your oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Stack two cookie sheets together, and line the top one with parchment paper (this isn't necessary, but in my experience gives you the best results). Prep three stacks of cookie sheets — if you don't have enough, just lay out three sheets of parchment paper.
Sift or grind together the powdered sugar, almond flour, and cocoa powder. Set aside.
In the bowl of a standing electric mixer, beat the egg whites, gradually and then increasing the speed to high, until they begin to rise and hold their shape. While whipping, sprinkle in the granulated sugar, and continue beating a few more minutes until you form stiff peaks.
Carefully fold the dry ingredients into the beaten egg whites with a flexible rubber spatula. Continue to mix until it becomes a batter that will pour off of your spatula in a thick-yet-pourable (not plop-able) stream — the party line in macaron-making is going for something that "flows like magma". You want it so that when the batter pours down it will hold its shape for a few seconds, but then gradually slump down into the remaining batter. Yes, you will be deflating things. But that's okay. Think about the fact you're going to pipe cookies that you want to hold their shape somewhat, but not maintain the peak from where you piped them.
When the mixture has reached this stage, transfer it into a pastry bag, or plastic bag (if the latter, then snip off a corner). Pipe one-inch circles onto your parchment paper, with about an inch between them (I just aim for as small as I possibly can). Repeat with remaining batter and sheets.
When the cookies are all piped, rap the baking sheet against the counter once or twice to pop air bubbles (if you have free range sheets of cookies, you can lift up the parchment by both sides, and then drop it from a height of a few inches). Bake about 12-15 minutes, until the cookies are set just enough on the bottom where you can almost peel one off. Remove, let set on the sheet a few minutes, and then remove the cookies to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining cookies — if you're recycling cookie pans, let them cool slightly between batches. And don't worry about the cookies sitting out on the counter awaiting their turn in the oven — some recipes actually recommend that.
When the cookies are baked and cooled, heat the cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan. When the cream just begins to boil at the edges, remove from heat, and add the chopped chocolate. Let sit one minute, then stir until smooth. Stir in the pieces of butter. Let cool until it becomes thick-yet-still spreadable (I kept trying to speed this up in the fridge, then missing my window and needing to microwave it — seriously like 3 times). When the ganache is ready, take a spoon or knife or small spatula, and place a small spoonful of ganache on the flat bottom of a cookie. Find a similarly sized cookie (if yours, like mine, um, vary a bit), and sandwich them together. Let age a day before eating, or store in the freezer for a few weeks.

Bagel Chips
Rating:
1
Ingredients
bagels, sliced as thinly as possible
olive oil
seasonings (salt, chopped or pressed garlic, fresh rosemary, etc.)
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Place the bagels in a bowl, and barely coat them with olive oil (If you have one of those olive oil misters or a pastry brush, those work perfectly, but if you're like me, just drizzle with a bit of oil, place another large bowl over the top, shake madly, and repeat as necessary until they're all lightly coated). Toss with any desired seasonings, and turn out onto a cookie sheet(s) in a single layer. Bake, turning once or twice, until they're cooked to your desired level of browning, ~15-25 minutes. They will crisp up further upon cooling.

Harissa Salmon with Lemony Herbed Couscous
Servings:
4
Rating:
3
Ingredients
2 tablespoons harissa paste (this North African spice paste can usually be found at Middle Eastern markets and well-stocked grocery stores — they recommend rose harissa, which I cleverly faked with some regular old from-the-tube harissa combined with some dried rose petals)
1 tablespoon coriander seeds, lightly bashed in a mortar and pestle
salt and oil as needed
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 pound salmon fillet
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed to finish
2 cups Israeli couscous
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
hefty pinch saffron
several large handfuls herbs, roughly chopped (parsley, cilantro, mint, scallions)
Directions
In a small bowl, mix together the harissa, coriander seeds, and half the lemon zest (reserve the remaining zest and juice). If your harissa is particularly thick, you can drizzle in some oil to make it spreadable.
Lay the salmon fillet out on a baking sheet, and gently spread the harissa mixture over it. Let it marinate at room temperature while you preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Bake the salmon until it just barely begins to flake (or think about flaking), ~10 minutes or so, depending upon thickness. Remove, and let sit for a few minutes.
While the salmon is baking, prepare the couscous. Heat the olive oil over a medium heat in a medium pot, then add the couscous and stir for a minute to toast. Add the broth and saffron (and additional salt if your broth isn't terribly salty), and raise the heat to a boil. Lower until it's just high enough to maintain a simmer, and cook, covered, until the liquid is absorbed and the couscous is tender, ~10 minutes.
When the couscous is done, stir in the reserved lemon zest and juice, and the fresh herbs. Add an additional drizzle of olive oil if needed to moiston, and salt to taste. Turn out onto a serving platter or individual plates, and top with the salmon, flaked.

Sloppy Sauce (aka Tahini with Miso and Almond Butter)
Rating:
2
Ingredients
1 Tbsp miso (any type)
2 Tbsp tahini
2 Tbsp almond butter
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2" ginger, grated
juice of 1 lemon
water
handful minced scallions and/or cilantro (optional)
Directions
Mix together the miso, tahini, and almond butter until well combined. Stir in the garlic and ginger, then the lemon juice. Add water, a little at a time, until it reaches a thick-but-pourable consistency (~1/4+ cup). Stir in the scallions and/or cilantro, if using. Taste, and adjust seasonings as needed. Pour over whatever hippie concoction you desire. The sauce will thicken upon standing, so just stir in a little additional water or lemon juice to loosen leftovers.

Mushroom Leek Quiche with Goat Cheese
Servings:
8
Rating:
0
Ingredients
1 pie crust, par-baked if you have the patience for it (I made this latest one with a half whole-wheat rough puff pastry)
2 tablespoons butter, plus a few thinly-sliced pats for dotting the top
1 large leek, or 2 small, washed and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon high-heat oil, such as grapeseed
1 pound mushrooms, cleaned and thinly sliced
1/4 pound Swiss cheese, grated (you can substitute gruyere or emmental)
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled into big hunks
2 cups milk or half-and-half
2 egg yolks
3 whole eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
pinch white pepper
pinch grated nutmeg
handful chives, minced (optional)
Directions
Melt the butter in a large saute pan or cast-iron skillet over a medium flame. Saute the leeks until well softened, but not browned, ~10 minutes (adjust heat as needed). Transfer to a small bowl, and set aside.
Raise the heat in the pan to high, and add the oil. When hot, add the mushrooms — you don't want it to be more than a generous layer or so deep, so you made to do this in batches. Salt lightly, and cook without moving until the liquid comes out and then evaporates (a few minutes). Stir, and cook the other sides until done. Repeat with remaining mushrooms and additional oil, if needed. These steps can be done in advance.
When you're ready to assemble your quiche, preheat your oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Take your (possibly par-baked) crust, and scatter the grated cheese over it. Add the leeks and mushrooms, then top with the goat cheese. You can leave as is, or tumble it up a bit.
In a large bowl, mix together the milk or half and half, eggs and egg yolks, nutmeg, salt and pepper, and chives, if using. Whisk gently, so that the mixture is combined but not frothy. Pour this custard mixture into the quiche shell (depending on its depth, you may not need all of it). Scatter the butter over the top.
Carefully place the quiche in the oven, and bake until only the center inch or so wiggles when you nudge it (about an hour). Remove from the oven, and let set a bit before serving.

1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1 tbsp vegetable or canola oil, plus more for brushing
Directions
In a shallow bowl, combine the bourbon, water, vinegar, ginger, chile, and garlic. Add the pork tenderloins and turn to coat. Marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, turning every 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
Remove the pork from the marinade; brush off any excess and pat dry. In a small saucepan, boil the marinade over high heat until reduced by one third, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the sorghum molasses and ketchup and cook over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet. Brush the tenderloins lightly with oil and season them with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Sear the pork over high heat, turning occasionally, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the barbecue sauce over the pork and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast for about 12-14 minutes, or until cooked through, turning the meat in the sauce. Transfer the pork to a work surface, cover with aluminum foil, and let stand for at least 5 minutes.
To serve, thickly slice the meat across the grain and serve with any remaining sauce.

Chilaquiles with Pepitas, Charred Corn and Black Beans
Rating:
1
Ingredients
For salsa verde:
1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, peeled and cut in half
6 cloves garlic
1 small onion, roughly chopped
1 serrano or jalapeño pepper
, stemmed and halved
Kosher salt
juice of 1 lime
1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro
For chilaquiles:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 ear corn, kernels removed
8 oz tortilla chips
(we used multigrain, but the recipe originally called for corn tortilla chips)
1 cup canned black beans (about half of a 14-ounce can), drained and rinsed
1 avocado, thinly sliced
1 small onion, thinly sliced, slices placed in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1/2 cup toasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
crumbled cotija cheese
Directions
Preheat broiler to high. Place tomatillos, garlic, onion, and pepper on a foil-lined heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet. Broil without moving until well charred on top side, about 15 minutes. Flip vegetables with a spatula and continue broiling until well-charred and completely softened, about 15 minutes longer (ours didn't take nearly this long to char and soften, but then again, maybe we under-charred).
Transfer vegetables to a food processor and allow to cool for a few minutes.  Add cilantro and lime juice.  Process until roughly pureed. Season salsa verde to taste with kosher salt and set aside.
Heat oil in a medium skillet over high heat until smoking. Add corn kernels, toss to coat, and cook without moving until charred on one side. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally until well charred all over, about 6 minutes total. Add black beans.  Season to taste with kosher salt and remove from heat.
Heat 1 1/2 cups salsa verde and 1 cup water in a large saucepan until simmering. Add tortilla chips and fold with a rubber spatula until all the chips are coated. Transfer chips to a large serving dish or individual serving plates. Top with charred corn, black beans, avocado slices, sliced onion, chopped cilantro, toasted pumpkin seeds and cotija cheese.
Serve immediately with additional salsa verde.

Pumpkin Whoopie Pies with Caramel Cream Cheese Filling
Rating:
5
Ingredients
For the whoopie pies:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons cinnamon
1 tablespoon ginger
2 teaspoons nutmeg
1 teaspoon cloves
2 cups brown sugar, pakced
1 cup vegetable oil
3 cups pumpkin puree
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
For the caramel cream cheese filling:
3/4 cup butter
1 cup cream cheese
1/2 tablespoon vanilla
6 cups powdered sugar
caramel ice cream topping
Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. In a separate large bowl, stir together the brown sugar and oil until completely combined . Add the pumpkin puree, followed by the eggs and vanilla, mixing well after each ingredient is added.
3. Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the wet ingredients, and stir until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated.
4. Using an ice cream or cookie scoop, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets about one inch apart. I used a 1/4-cup scoop and ended up with 24 cakes, which made 12 large whoopie pies. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops begin to crack and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean. Cool the cakes completely on the pans.
5. While the cakes are baking, make the filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter and cream cheese at medium-high speed for about two minutes. Add the vanilla and beat one minute more. Reduce the speed to stir and add the powdered sugar about 1/2 cup at a time. Once the sugar is completely incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat for about two minutes.
6. Assemble the whoopie pies:
Prepare your decorating bag. You can either use a disposable pastry bag or a gallon-size plastic storage bag. After fitting your decorating bag with a large round piping tip, use a small spatula to paint stripes on the inside of the bag with the caramel ice cream topping. Next, fill the bag with the cream cheese frosting. Squeeze the frosting out into a small bowl until you begin to see the stripes of caramel in the frosting.
Match up the cooled cakes according to size and shape. Pipe 2-3 tablespoons of frosting onto one cake in each pair. Top the frosted cakes with the unfrosted cakes and press down gently. Chill for 30 minutes before serving.

10 oz daikon radish

Gnocchi with Brussels Sprouts and Walnuts
Rating:
3
Ingredients
2 lbs brussels sprouts (or less, if you're not as sprout-happy as I am)
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 lb pre-made gnocchi
2 Tbsp butter or olive oil
1/4 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
salt and pepper
Parmesan or Romano cheese for serving
Directions
Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Rinse the Brussels sprouts, and trim off the bottom if needed. Slice in half, and toss with the olive oil until well coated. Spread out in a single layer (roughly) in a casserole dish, and roast at 450, turning occasionally, until they are tender and deep brown in spots, ~30 minutes. Set aside.
When the sprouts are almost done, cook the gnocchi in boiling water according to the manufacturer's directions. Drain. Heat the butter or olive oil in a large skillet or pot over a medium-high flame, and add the gnocchi. Cook until just beginning to brown, and then add the roasted Brussels sprouts. Cook to heat through. Add the walnuts, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve with grated cheese.

Stir-Fried Lettuce with Seared Tofu and Red Pepper
Rating:
1
Ingredients
2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
1 tbsp chicken broth, vegetable broth or water
4 tsp soy sauce
2 tbsp vegetable oil
16 oz firm tofu, drained on paper towels and cut into dominoes or diced
1 tbsp ginger, minced
2 large garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 tsp serrano or jalapeño chili, minced (I went a little heavy here, but you can totally cut it back to 1 tsp)
1 red bell pepper, julienned
2 large romaine hearts, cut crosswise into 1-inch-wide ribbons
Salt to taste
2-3 tbsp chopped cilantro
Directions
Mix together the rice wine/sherry, the broth/water and 2 tsp soy sauce and set aside.
Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch steel skillet over high heat until a drop of water evaporates within a second or two when added to the pan. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil by adding it to the sides of the pan and swirling the pan, then add the tofu in batches (don't crowd the wok) and sear until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with remaining tofu. If the pan starts to look dry, add a little more oil. Once all of the tofu has been seared, return all of the tofu to the wok and add the remaining soy sauce. Toss and transfer the tofu to a plate.
Swirl in 1 tbsp oil and add the ginger, garlic and chili pepper and stir-fry for no more than 10 seconds, until fragrant. Add the red pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the lettuce and sprinkle on the salt (don't add too much salt - you there is soy sauce in the dressing and on the tofu already). Stir-fry for 1 minute, until the lettuce has begun to wilt. Add the rice wine mixture, cook 15 to 30 seconds, until the lettuce is bright and crisp tender.  Return the tofu to the wok, stir in the cilantro and remove from the heat.
Serve with rice.

Rhubarb Ketchup
Rating:
4
Ingredients
2 pounds rhubarb stalks, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1/3 cup ruby port
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 cup sugar
Zest of 1 orange, peeled in wide strips
Salt
Cayenne pepper
Directions
In a medium saucepan, combine the rhubarb with the port, vinegar, sugar and orange zest and bring to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and let steep for 30 minutes. Cover and simmer over moderately low heat, stirring often, until the rhubarb is just tender, about 5 minutes. Discard the orange zest. Transfer to a blender and puree (our rhubard had already essentially dissolved and the ketchup was already pretty smooth so we skipped this step). Season with salt and cayenne.
Serve With steaks, pork or veal chops, chicken, onion rings or bratwursts.

Go-To Vegetable Soup
Rating:
4
Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large or 2 small-medium onions, cut in a small dice
4 cloves garlic, sliced
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 cup barley
~8 cups vegetable broth (I tend to use homemade freezer stock or Rapunzel bullion these days)
6 carrots, peeled or scrubbed, and sliced into thick coins
3-4 stalks celery, thinly sliced
1 small head cabbage, thinly sliced/shredded
4 cups tomato puree
2 bay leaves
1-2 cups cooked (or par-cooked) beans
1 bunch chard, leaves and stems, washed and chopped (leaves can be roughly chopped, but make sure the stems are sliced thinly, like the celery)
1 handful chopped fresh herbs (dill, parsley, basil, or whatever you have — optional)
salt and pepper
Directions
Heat a large soup pot over a medium flame (if you have a mega stockpot you could make this in a single batch, but if not you'll need another pot later). Add the onions, along with a pinch of salt, and saute until they become translucent but haven't totally collapsed, ~10 minutes (adjust head as needed so that they soften without coloring). Add the garlic and paprika, and cook for another minute or two to soften. Add the barley and vegetable broth. Raise the heat until it reaches a boil, then reduce until it's just high enough to simmer. Cook for about half an hour, until the barley is par-cooked (you can use this time to prep the remaining vegetables).
After half an hour, transfer half the mixture into a second soup pot (unless your pot is epically large). Between the two pots, divide the carrots, celery, cabbage, tomato puree, and bay leaves. If the beans are only par-cooked, add them as well (if they're fully cooked, they'll come later). Add water to cover the mixture by a generous few inches. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat until it's somewhere between a very gentle boil and a healthy simmer. Cook ~45 minutes, until the carrots are fully softened and the cabbage is mostly translucent and softened. Add the beans (if fully cooked and not yet added) and the chard and fresh herbs. Simmer another 30 minutes, until everything is fully cooked and the flavors have blended. Season to taste, and serve. Soup improves upon standing (and isn't so bad after freezing, either).

Salt and Pepper Salmon with Herbs and Meyer Lemon
Rating:

Ingredients
2 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 1 tsp, separated
1/2 tsp meyer lemon zest
1/2 tsp dill, finely chopped
1/2 tsp thyme, picked and finely chopped
1/2 tsp garlic, minced
s&p;
2 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, skin-on
1-2 tbsp olive oil

Heat 1-2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is almost smoking.  Add 1 tsp butter.  Season the salmon on both sides with s&p.; Add the salmon to the pan, skin-side down. To get super crispy skin, cook the salmon almost to completion, about 6 minutes.
Flip the salmon and cook until flesh side is nicely seared, 1 to 2 minutes (if your salmon is thicker than 1 1/2-2 inches you can cook them another minute or two flesh-side down).
Remove from the pan and top with the room temperature compound butter.  The butter will melt over and coat the salmon.

Spinach-Mushroom Lasagna
Servings:
8 to 10
Rating:
0
Ingredients
7 tablespoons butter, divided
16 ounces sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup minced shallot
3 cloves garlic, minced
16 ounces frozen chopped spinach, thawed,squeezed dry
1 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 lasagna noodles
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup flour
1 1/4 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
1 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup dry white vermouth
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 lb jarlsberg cheese or provolone cheese or havarti cheese, shredded
1/4 lb smoked gouda cheese, shredded
1/4 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions; drain, rinse immediately with cold water and then drain again; toss with 1 Tbsp olive oil and set aside.
Melt 2 tablespoon butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat; add the mushrooms and cook until golden, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and add the green onions, shallots, and garlic, and sauté for 3 minutes.
Add the drained, chopped spinach, white pepper, and salt, stir well and sauté for an additional 5 minutes.
Transfer the mushroom/spinach mixture to a bowl and set aside (do not rinse out this pan - we're going to use it again in the upcoming steps).
Over medium heat melt the remaining butter in the previously-used saucepan; add the flour and cook, stirring constantly to keep it from browning.
Gradually add the chicken or vegetable broth, cream, and vermouth; cook, stirring occasionally, until smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes.
As soon as sauce begins to boil, remove it from the heat and season with thyme and basil.
Combine the shredded cheeses together until well mixed.
Butter, oil, or lightly spray the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Pour the half-and-half into the bottom of the baking pan.
Lay 4 cooked noodles in a single layer in the pan.
Layer with 1/3 each of the mushroom/spinach mixture and shredded cheeses, then coat with 1/3 of the sauce.
Repeat the process twice, ending with the sauce.
Sprinkle with grated Parmesan (if using).
Cover the pan with foil and bake at 350F for 20 minutes, then remove foil and bake 20 minutes longer.
Remove from oven and let sit 15 minutes before serving.

Quince Jelly
Rating:
1
Ingredients
quinces
lemon
sugar
Directions
Wash your quinces, rubbing off the fuzz. Then hack them into rough cubes, skin and pits and all — trim away any nasty brown or wormy bits, but beyond that it's all fair game. Toss the cubes in a large pot with enough water to cover by barely an inch or so. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat until it's just high enough to maintain a vigorous simmer. Cook until the quince bits are totally mushy-soft, and beginning to take on a rosy hue, about an hour (you can also do this in a pressure cooker).
Pour the mixture through a strainer to capture the quince cooking liquid (you can run the quince pieces themselves through a food mill, or simply compost them — they'll have given up most of their flavor to the liquid). Measure the resulting liquid, and for every quart, add the juice of a small lemon.
Pass the liquid through a single layer of cheesecloth or loose-weave dishcloth, then through a couple layers of cheesecloth (or a coffee filter), to end up with a clear pink liquid. This final straining can take a while. If you are lazy or late-starting like me, you can leave it to drip overnight, and make your jelly the next day.
When you're ready to make the jelly, pour the quince liquid into a wide-bottom pot, and add a generous 3/4 cup sugar for every cup of juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat slightly to a vigorous-but-not-crazy boil. You'll need to cook the mixture down to the gel point, which should take at least a half hour and up to an hour, over which time it will thicken and darken to a ruby color, and the quince flavor will concentrate. When you think it's becoming syrupy, place a few small plates in the freezer to chill. If you want to process the jelly, prepare your jars and start a boiling water bath.
To test the jelly, drip a few drops onto a freezer-chilled plate. Let sit a minute, then push into the edge of the drop with your finger. You don't need to see a full jelly-like set, but it should just begin to wrinkle and mound ahead of your finger as you push it. When it reaches this stage, you're done! Pour into your prepared jars, seal, and process in a boiling water bath if desired. The jelly may take some time to set, but will end up fairly firm.

Chewy Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies
Servings:
48
Rating:
0
Ingredients
4 tsp ground flax seeds (ground to a mealy powder in a spice grinder)
1/2 cup milk or soymilk
2 cups all purpose flour (or finely-milled whole wheat pastry flour)
3/4 cups cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
3/4 cup neutral oil (like canola)
2 cups sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1 cup chocolate chips
Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Whisk together flax seeds and soymilk, and let sit at least ten minutes (IMPORTANT: this allows the flax seeds to release whatever it is they release into the milk, which binds the cookies into a nice chewy consistency. If they don't sit long enough, you'll have disappointingly flat cookies).
In a large bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
Whisk together oil, sugar and vanilla. Add the flax mixture, and mix well. Fold in the dry ingredients in a few additions, being careful not to overmix. Add chocolate chips.
Form the dough into cookies, either by forming 1" balls with your hands, or scooping them out with a tiny ice cream scoop. Place on a cookie sheet (no need to grease), leaving 1" between cookies. Bake 10 minutes -- no longer! Let set on the sheets for 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack or plate to cook completely.

Warm Mushroom Salad with Shallots and Sherry Vinegar
Rating:
2
Ingredients
2 garlic cloves
2 thick slices of bread from a large rustic loaf, lightly toasted
5 tbsp evoo
1/3 lb shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps cut into 1/2-inch to 1-inch thick slices
s&p
1/3 lb oyster mushrooms, trimmed and left whole or cut in half if large
1/3 lb cremini mushrooms, stemmed, caps quartered
3 medium shallots, peeled and cut into thin rings
2 small heads of frisee, darker green outer leaves removed and yellow inner leaves torn
1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
1/4 cup 1/2-inch batons of fresh chives
1 tbsp sherry vinegar
juice of 1/2 lemon
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Rub the garlic firmly on both sides of each slice of toasted bread then break the bread apart into large, rough croutons to make about 25 croutons total.  Lay the croutons on a small baking sheet, drizzle with 1 tbsp evoo and toss.  Toast the croutons in the oven about 5 minutes, until golden brown but still slightly chewy in the middle.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl toss the mushrooms and the shallots with 3 tbsp evoo, s&p.  Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet.  Avoid overcrowding the baking sheet - it might be necessary to use two rimmed baking sheets to roast the mushrooms.  Roast until mushrooms are tender and edges are golden brown, about 10-12 minutes.  While the mushrooms are roasting, toss together the frisee, parsley, chives, sherry vinegar, remaining tbsp evoo and lemon juice.  Season to taste with s&p.  Toss roasted mushrooms and croutons with the frisee mixture.
Serve.

Dutch Split Pea Soup
Rating:
2
Ingredients
2 cups split peas
1 large carrot
2 leeks
2 onions
1/2 celeriac root
celery leaves
6 cups water
4oz bacon
2 pork chops
5 pork ribs
2 potatoes
pepper
salt
Optional: smoked sausage (I left this out)
Directions
Rinse your split peas and drain. Cut up your meat into bite size pieces. Chop your carrots, potatoes, onions, leeks, celeriac, and celery leaves.
(This is when I just dumped everything into the crockpot... but here are Dutch Girl Cooking's instructions) Now there are lots of different ways to cook a split pea soup. It also depends on how crunchy you want your vegetables to be. In my soup, I don’t want them crunchy at all—they have to blend in with the soup. I also go for easy and fast. Crock-pot style layering. First add two heaping cups of split peas and simply place the meat on top of that.
Now in with the celeriac root, carrots, onions, leeks, potato and sprinkle the celery leaves all over.
Pour in 6 cups of water and I’ve added a few beef bouillon cubes. You can also do this with plain salt, of course. Does this look pretty or what? You know it’s bound to be a flavor bomb!
Now pop the lid on, bring everything to a boil, lower the heat and leave it be. Simmer over low heat for about an hour to 75 minutes. I usually don’t even open the lid until an hour has passed by. Show some restraint and don’t stir. C’mon, you know you want to :)
After about 75 minutes, I took a peek. It smelled so good by then, gave everything a stir and put the lid back on and gave it another hour.
After two and a half hours had passed I performed my meat check. If I can easily pull the meat off the bones with a fork, I consider the soup done. It came off so easily, so I took the ribs out, plucked the meat and put it back in.
Now this is a pretty rich soup as is, but I’m a Dutch girl cooking, so we’re not there yet! Oh no, we’re not. I thinly sliced a smoked sausage and popped it right in with the rest of his meaty buddies. That’s the Dutch way.
Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle a little more chopped celery leaves on top.

Kentucky Butter Cake (aka wedding cupcakes)
Servings:
24
Rating:
1
Ingredients
Cake:
3 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp baking soda
heaping ½ tsp salt
1 cup butter, softened to room temperature
2 cups sugar
4 eggs (best if these are at room temperature)
2 tsp vanilla
1 cup buttermilk (best if this is at room temperature)
Glaze:
½ cup sugar
¼ cup butter
1 ½ tsp vanilla
2 Tbsp water
Directions
Preheat your oven to 350. Grease and flour a 9” bundt pan, or place liners in 2 dozen muffin cups. Set aside.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
Using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar, and beat until light and fluffy again, stopping a few times to scrape down the sides. Add the eggs, one by one, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides regularly. Add the vanilla, and mix well.
Lower the speed of the mixer, and add 1/3 of the dry mixture, mixing on low until just barely combined (stop just shy of a uniform mixture to avoid over-mixing), and scrape down the sides/bottom to enure there are no un-mixed pockets. Add half of the buttermilk, and again mix until barely combined. Repeat the process, adding half of the remaining flour mixture, all of the remaining buttermilk, and then all of the remaining dries. Pour into the prepared bundt or cupcake pans, and bake until a tester comes out clean (~50 minutes for a bundt cake, ~20 for cupcakes).
While the cake is baking, prepare the glaze. Combine all of the glaze ingredients in a medium saucepan. When the cake comes out of the oven, stir and simmer the glaze until the mixture begins to bubble. Pour the warm glaze over the warm cake in its pan.

Salty Chocolate Chunk Cookies
Rating:
0
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup powdered sugar
2 large egg yolks
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate
Maldon or other flaky sea salt
Directions
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, baking powder, kosher salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl; set aside.
Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar, sugar, and powdered sugar until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add egg yolks, egg, and vanilla. Beat, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, until mixture is pale and fluffy, 4-5 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low; slowly add dry ingredients, mixing just to blend. Using a spatula, fold in chocolate.
Spoon rounded tablespoonfuls of cookie dough onto 2 parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing 1-inch apart. Sprinkle cookies with sea salt.
Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until just golden brown around the edges, 10-12 minutes (the cookies will firm up as they cool). Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks; let cool completely.

Shrimp with Green Garlic
Servings:
2
Rating:
5
Ingredients
1 Tbsp neutral oil, like canola
1/2 cup (or more, if you have it) green garlic, julienned into 2" matchsticks
1 lb shrimp, shelled (I like to sit mine in a saltwater brine for about 15 minutes before draining and cooking to add flavor and moisture, but that's optional)
1 tsp curry powder
1 Tbsp fish sauce
splash water (1-2 Tbsp)
cooked jasmine rice for serving
Directions
Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over a medium-high heat. When hot, add the green garlic, and saute, stirring often, until it softens but doesn't color (~3-5 minutes). When the green garlic is soft, add the shrimp, cooking a few minutes until just shy of done (time will vary depending on the size of your shrimp and how well-done you like them, but it shouldn't take long). Sprinkle on the curry powder, stir to combine and toast the powder, then add the fish sauce and water to form a bit of sauce. Let cook a moment to remove the harsh edge, then remove from heat. Serve with the rice.

Mongolian Beef

Mongolian beef, PF Chang’s Style.
Ingredients
vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon ginger, minced
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
1 lb flank steak, sliced into thin strips
1/4 cup corn starch
2 large green onions
Directions
Mince the ginger and garlic. Give the green onions a good wash and strip off the first layer of green stalks. Chop the bottom half of the green onions and discard the roots. Save the top half for later.
Place the top half of the green onion in a separate dish, wash and set aside
Slice the flank steak against the grain into bite size strips, about ¼ of an inch thick. Many grocers sell pre-cut flank steaks and many of them will slice it thin for you too if it doesn’t come pre-sliced (in case you’re not that comfortable with a knife just yet).
Coat the sliced flank steaks with cornstarch. Have two separate plates, one filled with cornstarch, another to place your coated steaks. Coat them lightly – overdusting can make the sauce too thick. Let the steaks sit for about 10 minutes.
While waiting for the steak, make the sauce. In a large pot on medium heat, pour enough veggie oil to cover the bottom. When hot, sauté the ginger, garlic and onions. OH how good this part smells.
When the onions are cooked, add the soy sauce and water. Add the brown sugar last and stir until all the sugar is dissolved. Bring the heat up to high and allow the sauce to boil for about 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Lower the heat down to medium-low.
In a separate frying pan, or wok, pour about ½ to a cup of veggie oil. When the oil is hot, add the steak and sauté for about 3 minutes or until the beef starts to get that niiice brown seared color.
Using a slotted spoon, scoop out the steak and add it to the pot with the sauce. Let the steak simmer in the sauce until it is cooked through. Add the remaining green onions or serve it on top as a garnish.
Serve with jasmine rice.

Ingredients
2 chicken breast halves
1/4 cup Italian style breadcrumbs
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried parsley
salt and pepper
1 egg
1 tbsp. Dijon mustard
olive oil

Measure out the breadcrumbs, cornmeal, parsley, thyme, salt and pepper.
Mix the breading thoroughly. Taste and add more salt if needed. That’s right, I said taste! Bland breading makes a bland chicken, ya hear?
In a bowl, crack open one egg and add the dijon mustard. I added a few drops of honey and hot sauce just to sweet and spice it up. I’m daring like that.
Whip up the eggs and Dijon mustard until they are evenly combined in a golden-yellow eggy mixture. I added a bit of pepper because I like to live on the edge. Just a dash is all you need.
Take out a non-stick frying pan, add about 3 tablespoons of olive oil and heat on medium-high. While you’re heating the pan, take out the chicken breasts from the packaging. Slice the chicken breasts lengthwise to get thin cuts – highly recommend! Wash, pat dry, and plate. Season with a bit of salt and pepper.
Chicken breasts tend to be a bit thicker in the middle. If you don’t feel comfortable slicing it yourself, get your grocery store butcher to do it for you or take a mallet, put the chicken breast in between plastic wrap, and smash the living daylights out of it! Ok, not to that extreme, but you do want it somewhat flat.
When the oil is hot and ready, dip the chicken into the egg mixture then dredge in the breading mixture. Make sure all surfaces are covered. Shake off any excess breading and place in the hot pan. Allow to cook for 3-4 minutes on one side or until golden brown and crispy.
Flip over to the other side and also let cook for about 3 minutes, leaving heat on medium-high. Oooh my, this is the color and texture that you want. Droool. Turn off the heat and place the chicken on a separate plate. Done!
