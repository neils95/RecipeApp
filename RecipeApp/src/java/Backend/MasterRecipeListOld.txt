Servings:
2 1/4 cups
Ingredients
3 cups cornstarch
1 1/2 cups flour
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
24 ounces beer
4 to 6 colossal onions, 4-inch diameter or larger
Seasoned Flour (recipe follows) *
Oil for deep-frying
Directions
Creamy Chili Sauce (recipe follows) **
To make batter, mix cornstarch, flour and seasonings until well blended. Add beer; mix well. Set aside. For each onion, cut about 3/4-inch off the top of the onion; peel onion. With cut side of the onion up, cut into the onion, top to bottom, to form 12 to 16 pie-shaped wedges, which will become the &quot;petals&quot; but do NOT cut through the bottom (root end) of the onion. Using a paring knife cut off the &quot;petals&quot; in the center of the onion (about a 1-inch diameter circle). Do not cut a hole through the onion. Dip cut onion into seasoned flour and remove excess by shaking. Stir beer batter, then dip floured onion into batter and remove excess by gently shaking. Holding onion upright, separate &quot;petals&quot; to coat thoroughly with batter. Heat oil in deep fat fryer or deep saucepan to 375 to 400 F. Your container should never be more than half full of oil. There should be enough oil to cover the onion and to allow the onion to move freely in the saucepan. Do not allow the fat to smoke. Gently place onion in the fryer basket or other wire-frying basket. Deep-fry for 1 1/2 minutes. Turn over and fry 1 to 1 1/2 minutes longer or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Place onion upright in shallow bowl and cut out root end with a circular cutter or apple corer. Serve hot with Creamy Chili Sauce. (You can place a small bowl of sauce in the center of the onion.)
* Seasoned Flour: Combine 2 cups flour, 4 teaspoons paprika, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; mix well.
** Creamy Chili Sauce: Combine 1 cup each mayonnaise and dairy sour cream, 1/4 cup chili sauce and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; mix well.

Ingredients
3-6 pieces boneless/skinless chicken breasts cut into 1/4 inch cubes
1 Tbsp. olive oil
2 Tbsp. favorite BBQ sauce (we use a spicy-sweet sauce).
For the pizza
1 basic pizza dough
Cornmeal, semolina or flour for handling
1/2 C. favorite BBQ sauce (we use a spicy-sweet sauce).
2 Tbsp. shredded smoked Gouda cheese
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 C. small red-onion, sliced into 1/8 inch pieces
2 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
Directions
In a large frying pan, cook the chicken in olive oil over medium high heat until just cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Do not overcook. Set aside in the refrigerator until chilled through. Once chilled, coat the chicken with two tablespoons BBQ sauce; set aside in the refrigerator.
To make the pizza
Place a pizza stone in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 deg for once hour before cooking pizzas.
Use a large spoon to spread 1/4 cup BBQ sauce evenly over the surface of the prepared dough within the rim. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon smoked Gouda cheese over the sauce. Cover with 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella.
Distribute half the chicken pieces evenly over the cheese (approximately 18 pieces). Place approximately 18 to 20 pieces of red onion over the surface. Sprinkle an additional 1/4 cup mozzarella over the top of the pizza.
Transfer the pizza to the oven; bake until the crust is crisp and golden and the cheese at the center is bubbly (about 8 to 10 minutes). When the pizza is cooked, carefully remove it from the oven; sprinkle 1 tablespoon cilantro over the hot surface. Slice and serve.
Repeat with the remaining ingredients for a second pizza. (The two pizzas may be prepared simultaneously if you are careful in placing the pizzas at opposite corners of your pizza stone.)

Ingredients
1-1/2  cups finely crushed gingersnap cookies
2  tablespoons granulated sugar

5  8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
1-1/3  cups packed brown sugar
3  tablespoons all purpose flour
5  eggs
2  egg yolks
2  teaspoons vanilla
Caramel Topping*
2  1.4-ounce bars chocolate-covered English toffee, coarsely chopped
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and side of pan to form a watertight seal; set aside. For crust: In a medium bowl, stir together crushed gingersnaps and the 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Stir in melted butter. Press mixture onto the bottom of the foil-wrapped pan. Bake about 14 minutes or until crust starts to brown. Cool on a wire rack.
2. In a very large bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add brown sugar and flour; beat until smooth. Add eggs and egg yolks one at a time, beating after each addition just until combined. Beat in vanilla. Pour over crust, spreading evenly. Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to reach halfway up side of springform pan.
3. Bake about 50 to 55 minutes or until a 2-inch area around the outside edge appears set and the center appears nearly set when gently shaken. Remove springform pan from water. Cool in pan on wire rack for 15 minutes. Using a small sharp knife, loosen edge of cheesecake from side of pan; cool completely (about 1 3/4 hours). Remove foil. Cover and chill for 4 to 24 hours.
4. Before serving, in a small saucepan, bring whipping cream to simmering. Remove from heat. Add chocolate; stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in butter. Chill about 15 minutes or until mixture is slightly thickened, stirring once. Spoon topping onto cheesecake, spreading to cover top. Garnish with chopped English toffee. Makes 16 servings.
5. *Test Kitchen Tip: If you prefer, omit making the Caramel Topping and substitute 1-1/3 cups caramel apple dip. Heat the caramel dip just enough to make it pourable.

Ingredients
3  tablespoons dried sage leaves
3  tablespoons dried savory leaves
1-1/2  teaspoons whole white or black peppercorns
1  teaspoon celery salt
1  teaspoon paprika
1  10- to 12-pound turkey
Pear Stuffing (see recipe below)
Cooking oil or olive oil
1/4  cup all-purpose flour
Chicken broth or water
Salt and ground black pepper (optional)
Autumn fruits, such as pears, crabapples, and lady apples, and assorted fresh herbs, such as tricolor sage, sage, or bay laurel (optional)
Directions
1. In a clean, dry blender, combine sage, savory, peppercorns, celery salt, and paprika. Blend until coarsely ground. Set aside.
2. Rinse inside of turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Lightly spoon Pear Stuffing into neck and body cavities. Pull neck skin of turkey to back and fasten with a skewer. If a band of skin crosses the tail, tuck the ends of the drumsticks under band. If there is no band, tie drumsticks to the tail using 100-percent-cotton string. Twist wing tips under the back. Place any remaining stuffing in a casserole; cover and chill.
3. Brush turkey with cooking oil. Rub ground herb mixture over entire bird. If desired, loosen skin from breast and rub mixture over meat under breast skin to infuse greater flavor from rub into meat.
4. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of one of the inside thigh muscles. (The thermometer should not touch the bone.) Cover turkey loosely with foil. Roast in a 325 degree F oven for 2-1/4 hours.
5. Cut the band of skin or string between the drumsticks so the thighs will cook evenly. Continue roasting for 3/4 to 1-1/4 hours more or until thermometer registers 180 degree F to 185 degree F and stuffing registers 165 degree F. Uncover the last 30 minutes of roasting. Remove from oven. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes before carving. Bake any remaining stuffing, covered, the last 45 minutes of turkey roasting.
6. Transfer turkey to a serving platter. Pour pan drippings into a large measuring cup, scraping the browned bits into the cup. Skim and reserve fat from drippings. Pour 1/4 cup of the fat into a medium saucepan; discard the remaining fat. Stir in flour. Add enough chicken broth to remaining drippings to make 2 cups.
7. Add dripping mixture all at once to flour mixture in saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. If desired, season to taste with salt and pepper. If desired, garnish serving platter with fall fruits and assorted fresh herbs. Makes 12 to 14 servings.
Pear Stuffing: Rinse and drain 1/2 cup uncooked wild rice. In a medium saucepan, cook rice in 2 tablespoons butter or margarine over medium heat for 2 minutes. Carefully add two 14-ounce cans chicken broth. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Add 1-1/4 cups orzo pasta. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes more. Stir in 2 medium red pears, cored and cut into 1/2-inch cubes; 3/4 cup toasted chopped hazelnuts; 1/2 cup sliced green onion; 1/2 cup golden raisins; and 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger.

Ingredients
1  cup chopped celery
1  cup sliced fresh mushrooms or one 4-ounce can sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
1/2  cup chopped onion (1 medium)
1  teaspoon poultry seasoning or ground sage
1/4  teaspoon pepper
1/8  teaspoon salt
8  cups dry bread cubes*
1/2  to 3/4 cup chicken broth or water
1  10- to 12-pound turkey
Cooking oil
1/3  cup margarine or butter
Directions
1. For stuffing, in a medium saucepan cook celery; fresh mushrooms, if using; and onion in margarine or butter until tender but not brown; remove from heat. Stir in poultry seasoning or sage, pepper, and salt. Place dry bread cubes in a large mixing bowl; add onion mixture and, if using, canned mushrooms. Drizzle with enough broth or water to moisten, tossing lightly.
2. Season body cavity of turkey with salt. Spoon some of the stuffing loosely into neck cavity. Pull the neck skin to the back; fasten with a skewer.
3. Lightly spoon more stuffing into the body cavity. (Place any remaining stuffing in a casserole, cover, and chill. Bake stuffing alongside turkey for 30 to 45 minutes or until heated through.) Tuck the ends of the drumsticks under the band of skin across the tail. If the band of skin is not present, tie the drumsticks securely to the tail. Twist wing tips under the back.
4. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Brush with oil. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of one of the inside thigh muscles. The thermometer bulb should not touch the bone. Cover turkey loosely with foil.
5. Roast turkey in a 325 degree F oven for 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 hours or until thermometer registers 180 degrees F. The internal temperature of the stuffing should reach 165 degrees F. After 2-1/2 hours, cut band of skin or string between the drumsticks so thighs will cook evenly. When done, drumsticks should move very easily in their sockets and their thickest parts should feel soft when pressed. Uncover the last 30 minutes of roasting.
6. Remove turkey from oven. Cover; let stand 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Use a spoon to remove stuffing from turkey; place in a serving bowl. Carve turkey. Makes 12 to 14 servings.
*Note: To make dry bread cubes for stuffing, cut bread into 1/2-inch square pieces. (You'll need 12 to 14 slices of bread for 8 cups of dry cubes.) Spread in a single layer in a 15-1/2x10-1/2x2-inch baking pan. Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until dry, stirring twice; cool. (Bread will continue to dry as it cools.) Or, let stand, loosely covered, at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.
Make-Ahead Tip: Prepare stuffing cubes and freeze up to 1 month ahead. (Do not stuff turkey until just before roasting.)

Ingredients
1  cup chopped celery
1/2  cup chopped onion
1/4  cup margarine or butter
1  teaspoon dried rubbed sage
1/2  teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/4  teaspoon pepper
6  cups dry bread cubes
1/2  cup chopped pecans
1/2  cup dried cranberries
1/2  cup chicken broth
1  6- to 8-pound turkey
1  to 2 tablespoons chicken broth (optional)
1  teaspoon cooking oil
Directions
1. For stuffing, cook celery and onion in margarine or butter in a small saucepan until tender. Remove from heat. Stir in sage, thyme, and pepper. Place dry bread cubes in a mixing bowl. Add celery mixture, pecans, and cranberries. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth, tossing to moisten.
2. Release turkey legs from leg clamp or band of skin crossing the tail. If desired, remove leg clamp from body cavity. Rinse turkey inside and out; drain and pat dry with paper towels. Just before roasting, spoon some stuffing into neck cavity. Pull neck skin over stuffing; fasten to back with a short skewer.
3. Loosely spoon stuffing into body cavity (no more than 3/4 cup stuffing per pound of turkey.) Do not pack stuffing tightly, or it will not get hot enough by the time the turkey is cooked. (Transfer any remaining stuffing to a casserole, adding the 1 to 2 tablespoons chicken broth, if desired, for additional moistness; cover and chill casserole.) Tuck legs under band of skin or reset into leg clamp. If leg clamp has been removed, tie legs together with string. Twist wing tips under back.
4. Place stuffed turkey, breast side up, on rack in a shallow roasting pan. Brush with cooking oil. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of an inside thigh muscle so the bulb does not touch bone. Cover turkey loosely with foil, leaving some space between the bird and the foil. Press foil over legs and neck.
5. Roast in a 325 degree F oven for 3 to 3-1/2 hours or until thermometer registers 180 degree F and juices run clear. The center of the stuffing should be at least 165 degree F. Add covered casserole of stuffing during the last 30 to 45 minutes of roasting. If desired, during roasting, baste the turkey occasionally with drippings. Remove the foil the last 30 to 45 minutes to let the bird brown.
6. Remove turkey from oven and cover loosely with foil. Let stand for 20 minutes before carving. Release legs from leg clamp, or snip string or band of skin. To avoid possible burns, do not remove leg clamp from the hot bird after roasting. Remove stuffing from turkey. Store leftover turkey and stuffing in separate containers as soon as possible after serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

4  8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
1  8-ounce carton mascarpone cheese
1-1/2  cups sugar
2  eggs
2  tablespoons finely shredded lemon peel
3  tablespoons lemon juice
3  cups blueberries
1/2  cup sugar
1  tablespoon water
3  tablespoons lemon juice
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and side of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan to form a watertight seal; set aside.

Press mixture onto the bottom of the foil-wrapped pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F.
2. Meanwhile, for filling: In a very large bowl, combine cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and the 1-1/2 cups sugar. Beat on medium speed until smooth. Add eggs, lemon peel, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice; beat just until combined. Pour over crust, spreading evenly. Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to reach halfway up side of springform pan.
3. Bake for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours or until a 2-inch area around the outside edge appears set and the center appears nearly set when gently shaken. Remove springform pan from water. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Using a small sharp knife, loosen edge of cheesecake from side of pan; cool completely (about 1-3/4 hours). Remove foil. Cover and chill for 6 to 24 hours.

Ingredients
1-2/3  cups flaked coconut, toasted*
1/2  cup ground almonds
2  tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
3  8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
1/2  cup sugar
2  tablespoons amaretto or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3  eggs
3  egg whites
1/2  teaspoon vanilla
1/4  teaspoon cream of tartar
6  tablespoons sugar
1/3  cup flaked coconut
1  ounce semisweet chocolate
1  teaspoon shortening
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degree F.
2. For crust, combine 1 cup of the toasted coconut, the ground almonds, and melted butter or margarine in a small mixing bowl. Press mixture onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan; set aside.
3. For filling, beat cream cheese, the 1/2 cup sugar, and amaretto or almond extract in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Add the three whole eggs all at once. Beat on low speed just until combined. Do not overbeat. Pour filling into crust-lined pan. Place the pan on a shallow baking pan in the preheated oven.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. (Cheesecake will not be completely done.) Sprinkle with the remaining 2/3 cup toasted coconut.
5. Meanwhile, allow egg whites to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Combine egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar in a large mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Gradually beat in the 6 tablespoons sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat on high speed about 4 minutes more or until mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks (tips stand straight) and sugar dissolves. Carefully spread over partially baked cheesecake to within 1 inch of the pan. Sprinkle with the 1/3 cup coconut.
6. Return to oven and bake 12 to 15 minutes more or until lightly browned. Remove springform pan from baking pan. Cool cheesecake on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Cool 30 minutes more. Remove sides of the springform pan and let cheesecake cool for 1 hour. Cover and chill at least 4 hours before serving.
7. Just before serving, heat chocolate and shortening in a small saucepan over low heat until melted. Drizzle over cheesecake. Let stand until chocolate sets. Makes 12 to 16 servings.
*Note: To toast the coconut, spread it in a single layer in a shallow baking pan. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until light brown. Watch it carefully, and stir it so it browns evenly.

1  egg
2  tablespoons butter, melted
1/2  cup sugar
1/3  cup chopped walnuts
1-1/2  teaspoons ground cinnamon
Water (optional)
Sugar (optional)
Directions
1. In a large bowl, combine 1-1/4 cups of the flour and the yeast. Set aside.

Ingredients
Turkey breast (6-9 lbs.)
Turkey or chicken stock
Olive Oil
Potatoes
Carrots
Celery
Onions
Garlic
Poultry seasoning
Parsley
Salt
Crushed black pepper
Directions
24-hours in advance take thawed turkey and rub a small amount of olive oil over turkey - inside and out.  Next rub salt, pepper, parsley, and poultry seasoning on the inside and out of the turkey.  Place back in refrigerator.
Cut carrots, celery, potatoes, and onion into large pieces.  Place a layer on the bottom of the crock pot.  Pour a small amount of stock on the bottom on the crock pot, enough to cover the bottom to steam the turkey.  Season vegetables with additional seasonings.  Place more vegetables in the cavity of the turkey.  Place turkey in the crock pot and add additional seasoned vegetables around the turkey.
Start cooking the turkey.  For at least an hour leave the temperature setting on high, then change the temperature to low.  Cook for around 8 to 10 hours, depending on the size of the turkey.  Provided you don't open the lid many times basting should not be necessary.  Turkey should be at least 165-degrees internally before consumption.
Remove turkey from crock pot and cut to serve.  Vegetables can be eaten or discarded.  Stock and turkey broth combination can be used for gravy.

Ingredients
1 Â½ cups cracked wheat kernels
2 Â½ cups Samuel Adams Light
Â½ cup honey or brown sugar
6-7 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons dry yeast
1 Â½ cups warm water (110Â°)
1/3 cup vegetable oil (110Â°)
2/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup toasted walnuts, coarsely chopped
1 egg white whisked with 1 or 2 tablespoons warmed honey for glaze
Directions
Roast the wheat kernels in a 400Â° oven, stirring frequently until brown. Combine the wheat kernels in pan with beer and Â½ cup of honey. Simmer on low 1 hour, covered. Uncover, raise heat slightly, and simmer an additional hour or until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.
Crush the cooked wheat in a food processor or blender until fine but not pureed. Set aside.
Place 1 cup flour in large mixing bowl. Mix in dry yeast, pour in warm water, and stir thoroughly. Cover and allow to site for 15-20 minutes.
Whisk oil, 2/3 cup honey, salt, walnuts, and cooked wheat into yeast mixture.
Stir in remaining flour one cup at a time using your hands once the dough becomes too heavy for a spatula. Continue adding flour until dough begins to pull away from sides of the blwl and kneading can begin. Knead thoroughly by pushing and turning, adding only enough flour to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands or surface. When dough is smooth and elastic, coat the inside of large bowl with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Press the ball of dough into the bowl and turn it over, coating the entire surface with oil.
Cover and allow to rise in a warm spot until doubled. When doubled in bulk, punch down, devide in half, and allow to rest 5 minutes, covered.
To shape the dough into loaves, coat an area of the counter with a few drops of oil. Pat the dough into an 8&quot;x10&quot; rectangle.
Starting at the narrow end, roll firmly buy gently into a cylinder. Do not stretch the dough. Pinch ends and turn them under toward the seam side. Slam the dough onto the counter, seam-side down, two or three times to seal and remove large air bubbles.
Place the loaves seam-side down in generously greased loaf pans. Cover and allow to rise until doubled.
Brush with glaze and bake at 350Â° for 25-30 minutes or until tops are golden and bottoms are brown.

Cook Time:

Ingredients
1/2 cup butter
2-oz dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 tsp red food coloring
2/3 cup all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
8-oz cream cheese, room temperature
1/3 cup sugar
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Directions
Preheat oven to 350F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 8 inch metal baking pan. Put a long piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan, letting the parchment extend up two sides of the pan and overhang slightly on both ends. (This will make it easy to remove the bars from the pan after they have baked.) Butter the parchment.
In a small, heatproof bowl, melt butter and chocolate together. Stir until combined and very smooth. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, vanilla extract and red food coloring. Add chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Add flour and salt and stir until just combined and no streaks of dry ingredients remain.
Pour into prepared pan and spread into an even layer.
To prepare cheesecake mixture, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg and vanilla extract in a medium bowl until smooth. Distribute the cheesecake mixture in 8 dollops over batter in the pan. Swirl in with a knife or spatula.
Bake for 35-40 minutes, until brownies and cheesecake are set. A knife inserted into the cheesecake mixture should come out clean and the edges will be lightly browned.
Let cool completely in pan on a cooling rack before lifting out the parchment paper to remove the brownies.

Ingredients
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg
Fudge Sauce:
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 Tbsp. cocoa powder
Directions
Cream the peanut butter and sugar in a bowl. (This is a hand-stirring job). Beat in the baking powder. Add the egg. Mix until it is all well combined.
The dough will be sticky, so be prepared to get your hands messy. Roll some dough into a ball. (How big? That depends on you. I have found, however, that the smaller these cookies are, the better they hold together. Eat two instead of one!) Roll the ball into white sugar. Line a baking sheet, covered in parchment paper, with sugary balls of dough.
Bake in the oven for about ten minutes. You will know the cookies are done when they feel coherent, but still a little soft. Take the tray out of the oven and let the cookies rest for at least five minutes. Afterwards, carefully transfer them to a cooling rack. After ten minutes or so, they will have hardened and be glistening with sugar.
Once cookies are out of the oven mix fudge sauce ingredients in a microwave-save container.  Microwave for about 1 minute.  Place fudge sauce in a pastry bag and pipe fudge sauce on cookies in a swirl pattern.  Place finished cookies in fridge to set.

Ingredients
3 ripe avocados
1/2 of a big sweet yellow onion
1/2 a box of grape tomatoes
1 bunch of cilantro
1 Serrano pepper (can use jalapeÃ±o to make it less hot)
Lime juice
Directions
Dice up the avocado and onions.
Quarter the grape tomatoes.
Chop up the cilantro but be careful with it as it is tender.
Cut off the top of the pepper and remove the core with the seeds and the veins. This is the part of the pepper that makes it super hot.
Chop the remaining pepper.
Combine all the ingredients into a bowl and mix up.
Add lime juice to keep the avocados from browning.

Ingredients
1 box of  Penne
2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
1 bag of frozen broccoli (or cauliflower)
salt
pepper
garlic powder
Directions
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add a tad of extra virgin olive oil and then add the bag of frozen veggies. Cook to desired tenderness. The brighter green the veggies, the more nutrients that remain.
A great alternative to boiling the veggies is to steam them. It holds more of the nutrients. If you have a rice cooker with a steam basket, or a steamer, use it.
Bring water to a boil. Add a touch of olive oil to the water and then add pasta once itâ€™s boiling. Cook your pasta to itâ€™s desired tenderness. Being Italian, we like it al dente (to the teeth), not mushy.
After both pasta and veggies are cooked, toss together in a big bowl. Add the 2 tbsp of olive oil, a dash of salt, crushed black pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic if you like that better).
Alternatives: you can toss in cauliflower instead, toss in toasted multi-grain bread cubes for some crunch, or toss in some boiled shrimp for added protein!

Ingredients
2/3 cups whole wheat flour
2/3 cups bread flour
2 Tablespoons Quinoa
2 Tablespoons Oats
1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten (optional)
3 Tablespoons raw sugar or equivalent
1.5 teaspoons active yeast
2/3 cup water
2 Tablespoons cocoa powder (2 Tbsp gives a mild chocolate flavor)
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
1 Tablespoon Organic olive oil.
1/2 teaspoon salt
Cacao nibs(optional)
Directions
Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to 2 Tablespoons warm water and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes or until frothy.
Boil the remaining water( about 1/3 cup) and add rinsed quinoa to it. Cook until done, about 10 minutes. All of the water might not be absorbed.
In a blender, blend the quinoa and oats and sugar for a quick pulse to get a coarse mix. You can skip this step and add quinoa and oats directly to the dough to get grainy texture.
In a bowl add whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup bread flour, wheat gluten, cinnamon and salt and mix.
Add in the yeast mixture, oil and oat+quinoa+ sugar/sweetener and mix to combine.
Add 1/3 cup water at a time and Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes, scraping sides every 2-3 minutes if using a stand mixer. Add more flour or water in little quantities if needed. Keep the dough soft and not too sticky.
Some fun ways to knead the dough and build gluten!... beat it... yes beat it with a rolling pin, scrape up and beat again, or pound and punch it... or even better, flour your hands well and pick up and throw on the counter.. scrape and reshape every few throws.. in 3-4 minutes, the dough will start to get elastic and less sticky.! gluten!
Spritz the top of dough with some oil spray. Place dough in a covered container in a warm place for 1.5 hours.
Punch it lightly. For mini loaf pans, divide dough into 2 parts. Knead and shape into a loaf by pulling on all sides, or by rolling it out into a rectangle and rolling the rectangle from one side and tucking the other edge under like a jelly roll. You can add some cacao nibs or vegan chocolate chips in it at this point before shaping into a loaf. I dint add any this time.
Place loaf in greased mini bread pans. Spritz the top with water and then spritz a little oil spray, and cover with damp towel.
Place it in a warm place or warm oven for 50 minutes.
Remove towel, spritz top with some water, sprinkle some oats and bake at preheated 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the bread sounds hollow. (35 minutes if baking one bigger loaf).
Remove bread from pan and let cool for an hour.
Slice and enjoy as is!

Ingredients
1 lb lean ground beef
Small handful of diced onion
1 15 oz can corn
1 15 oz can light or dark kidney beans
1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce
1 green pepper diced
1 package of McCormick's Original Chili Seasoning packet
Directions
Brown the ground beef with the diced onion in a skillet. While that is cooking, pour all the canned items, green pepper, and seasoning packet together in either a crockpot or large soup pot. While some recipes tell you to drain the cans first, DON'T! By doing so, you are letting the yummy juices escape. Pour it all in and not only are you getting more flavor, you are 'stretching' the chili. Once the beef is done, drain and add it to the crockpot/pot.  I would suggest making this in the crockpot and stirring it a few times on low over the course of 2-3 hours.

2 1/2 lbs ground beef

1 box jumbo pasta shells
1/2 pkg regular cream cheese
2 jars taco sauce
2 cups crushed tortilla chips
1 teaspoon each salt & chili powder
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3 cups shredded mixed cheese
Garnishes could include: diced tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, etc.
Directions
Cook pasta shells according to package.  Meanwhile, cook beef in large skillet over medium-high heat until brown, stirring to separate meat; drain fat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add cream cheese, salt and chili powder; simmer 5 minutes. Toss shells with butter (so they don't stick to one another) and let cool about 5 minutes so that you can handle them. Fill shells with beef mixture and arrange in a buttered 13x9 inch pan. This is the part where it really helps to have the extra set of hands - it just makes it go quicker plus it's more fun to have help! Pour taco sauce over each shell - be liberal! Cover with foil and bake in a 350 oven for 15 minutes. Uncover, top with cheese and chips and bake an additional 15 more minutes or until bubbly. Serve alongside whatever toppings you wish: tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  We usually serve this with chips & our favorite salsa.  Each person usually eats 4 shells which means this dish makes a solid 7 servings

Ingredients
Topping:
1 cup sugar & 1 tablespoon cinnamon
Cookie Dough:
3 1/2 cups flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon each salt & cinnamon
1 1/2 sticks butter
2 cups sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 eggs
2 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup each dried cherries (cut in half) and sliced almonds
Directions
Mix topping ingredients together and set aside.  Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together and set aside. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Continue to mix, adding eggs, corn syrup and vanilla; mix thoroughly.  Add the dry ingredients, dried cherries and sliced almonds to the bowl and mix until blended.  If the dough is sticky or difficult to handle, wrap and chill the dough for an hour. The dough tends to be pretty crumbly but I have always been able to make it into balls quite easily.
Roll balls of dough (about the size of a walnut) and roll in the cinnamon sugar topping to coat. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 1/2 inches apart. You do not need to press these down until little disks; just leave them as little balls.  Bake for 10-12 minutes (less is better!) in a 375 degree oven until the cookies puff slightly and the surface is slightly cracked. Let cool on a cookie sheet a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool.

Garlic salt, salt, and pepper
Olive oil
Directions
In a bowl, mix together the mashed potatoes and egg thoroughly.  Make 3&quot; patties with the mixture and have a thickness of about 1/4&quot; - 1/3&quot;.  On one side, salt and pepper the patties. Flip them over and lightly sprinkle garlic salt and pepper.  Heat up olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, place the patties over the olive oil - that's what makes it brown so nice.  Wait 8 minutes before flipping them. It will feel like a really long 8 minutes the first time ) but if you flip them too early, they will fall apart.  Wait another 6-8 minutes for the other side to become golden brown.
Note: For an extra twist, add some fresh chopped parsley to the mixture before making the patties. It'll brighten the flavor and your plate.

2 â€“ 2 Â½ lbs pork loin
1 bottle barbecue sauce
2 tablespoons mustard
1 tablespoon each Worcestershire & ketchup
1 Â½ teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper
Directions
Spray slow cooker with PAM liberally.  The pork loin usually comes split in half. I like to cut mine in half crosswise so that the pulled pieces arenâ€™t so long.  Place the pork down in the crockpot and then mix all the ingredients on top of it.  I actually make this the night before and let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Then turn it on in the morning and cook it for about 6 hours on low.  I've found that it's better not to cook it for longer than 6 hours or you could burn it and no one wants burnt pulled pork.  When it is done, use two forks to pull it apart. Spoon the mixture over it and let it sit for 5 minutes more before serving.

pinch of salt
7 tablespoons softened butter, diced
3/4 cup walnuts
2 1/2 lbs baking applies, cut into 3/4&quot; chunks
2 cups raspberries
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon vanilla

Trim fat from meat and cut meat into 3/4&quot; pieces. In your crockpot, combine all ingredients EXCEPT for the frozen peas.  Stir well, then cover and cook on low-heat for 8-10 hours or high 4-5 hours.  About 5 minutes before serving, discard the bay leaf and stir in the frozen peas. Peas loose their color and texture if they are thrown in at the beginning of this recipe. Since they cook so quickly, it's best to toss them in at the end.  Makes a strong 4-5 servings.

Ingredients for Teriyaki marinade:
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Optional: I have ground ginger in my fridge so I actually used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger & 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic.
Ingredients for complete meal:
1 lb chicken breast, cut into strips
1 20 oz can pineapple tidbits
1/2 cup diced green peppers
2 cups cooked rice, for serving
Directions
Mix all marinade ingredients together in a resealable container. Once mixed, toss in the chicken strips and stir to coat the strips. Place in the fridge and forget about it for a couple hours or a day.  When you are ready to make the meal, heat a skillet to medium heat and add the chicken strips, half a can of the tidbits (use more if you wish or save the other half of the can for a snack), and the green peppers. I would add about 1/2 to 3/4 of the teriyaki marinade into the skillet (see note below). This will provide a nice amount of sauce to go over the rice. Mix the chicken around until all pieces are cooked through (white throughout). Place a mound of rice on your plate and a spoonful of the chicken teriyaki on top.

Ingredients
Red or yukon gold potatoes
4 strips bacon, crumbled
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Kraft Zesty Italian dressing
Directions
Scrub potatoes and pat dry on a towel. Using a fork, prick the top of the potato about 5-7 times. If you've had a rough day, feel free to take out the anger on the potato! Place the potatoes in a 9x9 or similar glass baking dish; then add about 1/3&quot; inch of water to the bottom of the dish. Microwave for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, fry off bacon until crispy. Remove bacon and crumble; discard bacon drippings from skillet.
Once the microwave goes off, the real fun begins.  Place one potato on a flat surface and use the bottom of a plate to 'smash' the potato to about 1/2-3/4&quot;.  The potato may break apart a little bit but it will mostly stay intact.
Squirt a tablespoon or so of Zesty Italian dressing into the skillet and allow it to heat up for a minute. Place your smashed potatoes over the dressing and allow to cook for about 4 minutes.
Once browned and cooked on that side, flip it over with a large spatula. You may need to add a small drop or two of dressing under each when you flip it. Once all are flipped, add a small bit of cheese and bacon on top. Cook for 4 minutes on this side and then serve.  You will be surprised at how much flavor the Zesty Italian dressing adds.

Ingredients
1 bag frozen ravioli
1 cup frozen peas
4 oz prosciutto, cooked until crispy, then chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 small carton whipping cream, contains about 1 cup
1 cup of pasta water
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan
olive oil
Directions
With about a tablespoon of olive oil in a heated skillet, fry the prosciutto.  When crispy (but not burnt), remove the prosciutto and place on a paper towel so that any grease can drain.  When cool, chop until smaller pieces.  In the skillet, add about another tablespoon of olive oil and the garlic.  Allow the garlic to brown in the skillet for 2 minutes.  Next, add the tomato paste and cup of pasta water and stir together for about 1 minute.  Add the whipping cream and stir to mix well.  Your sauce should be a nice salmon cover.  If you want it to be a stronger red sauce, add more tomato paste.  You should continue to stir this mixture on medium heat for 3-5 minutes. It will thicken into a nice sauce. Remember, the longer you have it on the heat, the thicker it will become. If you love sauce like I do, you can add a little bit of chicken stock to stretch the sauce.
As you are making the sauce above, boil a pot of water.  Add the whole bag of frozen ravioli. It only takes about 5 minutes for ravioli to cook. During the last 2 minutes of cooking time, toss in the peas so that they cook. Drain when both are ready.  You should time the ravioli to hit the water at about the same time as the whipping cream goes into the skillet.  This will help make the meal come together at the perfect time!
Once your sauce is to your desired consistency, toss the prosciutto in the pan and stir to coat. Then add the parsley, peas, and ravioli and toss to mix well.  Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top and serve!  I apologize for the long set of instructions but trust me that this meal is pretty simple to make and absolutely delicious. Once you make it once, it will be even more of a cinch to whip together!

1 8oz can tomato sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
1 bay leaf
1 cup dried orzo pasta or any little pasta
Directions
This recipe calls for a dutch oven; however, if you do not have one, I'd venture to say that you can use a large stockpot but you may want to check it more frequently to stir and make sure ingredients do not stick to the bottom.
In your dutch oven/pot, cook sausage, onion, carrot, and celery over medium heat until sausage is brown. Break up the sausage while cooking so that you have nice bite size pieces instead of a big lump.  Drain well.
Add all other ingredients EXCEPT pasta.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Simmer does not mean that it is boiling - you need to really take it down low. This is the part where those flavors will just meld together and make something unimaginable.  After the hour, add uncooked pasta. Return to a boil and reduce heat. Cook uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf before serving.

3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups (12-oz. pkg.) chocolate chips
Icing:  white royal icing and black tube icing (for the letters/numbers)
Directions
Preheat oven to 375.  In a mixer, cream both kinds of sugar and vanilla.  Once creamed, add eggs individually and then the vanilla.  In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add this dry mixture into the mixer until incorporated.  Add chocolate chips and stir in by hand.  Using your hands, smooth out the cookie dough into the bottom of two cookie sheets with sides.  It should be about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot; thick and cover the entire cookie sheet.  Bake for 13-20 minutes, depending on how firm you want them. I would suggest for this project to have the cookies somewhat firm.
Let the cookies cool completely.  Use a pizza cutter to cut the cookies into 1&quot; squares.  Use white icing to individually ice the top of the cookie. Let this firm up and then use the black icing to carefully write the number and letter on the cookie.

Ingredients
1 1/2 lbs boneless beef sirloin steak, cut 1 inch thick
3 Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 3/4&quot; pieces
2 cups loose-pack frozen cut green beans
1 small onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 1/2 cups thick and chunky salsa
1 14oz can low sodium beef broth
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
Directions
In a crockpot, mix together salsa, broth, basil and garlic. Trim the fat from meat, cut into 1-inch bite-size pieces and toss in the crockpot. Add in potatoes, green beans and onion.  Mix together to ensure that everything has been coated with the sauce mixture. Mine looked like there wasn't enough juice in there but as things cook, more juices will come out so don't worry!  Put the lid on the crockpot and place on low-heat for 8-10 hours or high-high for 4-5 hours. Stir every now and then if you are home. You'll know it is done when the potatoes and beef are easily speared with a fork. If you are within an hour of it being done and it still doesn't look like enough juice is there, add in some more veggies or beef broth.

1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 jar marinara sauce for serving
Directions
Preheat oven to 400.  Brush a baking sheet lightly with oil; set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 12x10 inch rectangle, about 1/4&quot; thick. I normally do not use a rolling pin because out of the canister it is about this size.  Place the pepperoni over the dough leaving a 1&quot; border around the edges. Top with both cheese.  Brush the edge of the dough with the beaten egg. Starting from the long side, roll the dough into a long cylinder, pressing the edges to seal. Transfer the stromboli to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Cover the stromboli lightly with nonstick aluminum foil to make a tent and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until golden, approximately 15-25 more minutes.  Let cool 5 minutes before slicing into 2-inch pieces. Serve with marinara.

Ingredients
12 cups Whole Wheat Herb-Focaccia, cut into 1&quot; cubes and dried
4 1/2 cup vegetable stock
1/4 cup vegan chicken flavored seasoning, optional
1 large leek, white and light green parts only, diced and washed
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 1/2-2 cups diced celery, about 3 large stalks
1 1/2 tbsp minced fresh thyme
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp minced fresh rosemary leaves
2 tsp minced fresh sage leaves
1/2 tsp poultry seasoning
1 large granny smith apple, peeled and diced
1 cup chopped, peeled roasted chestnuts
1 cup dried cranberries
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and black pepper to taste
Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a small sauce pan, heat vegetable stock just to a simmer and whisk in vegan chicken flavored seasoning.  Remove from heat and set aside.
Add focaccia croutons to a large bowl and set aside.
Heat a large saute pan on medium-low and add olive oil, leeks, onions, celery, garlic, thyme, sage, rosemary, poultry seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste and saute for about 7-10 minutes until soft.  Add diced apples and cook about 3 minutes longer. Turn off heat and let cool to room temperature.
Add leek-onion-celery mixture to croutons, along with cranberries and chopped chestnuts and stir well to combine.  Add two cups of vegetable stock and stir well.  Let sit for a minute or so before adding another 1 cup of stock and stir well.  Repeat adding about 1/2 cup of stock at a time until the croutons are soft, but still hold their shape.  You want them to be moist, but not mushy or dry.  Because my croutons are made with whole wheat, they are denser and I used the entire 4-1/2 cups veg stock.  If you purchase store-bought croutons or use white bread you may use less veg stock.
Check for seasonings and add salt and pepper to taste if needed.  Butter a 12x9 or similar size casserole dish with Earth Balance and spoon dressing into dish and distributing evenly. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, rotate the dish and bake another 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
Serve immediately.

1 pie
Ingredients
3/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats, finely ground
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
2 to 3 tablespoons very cold water
Directions
COMBINE flour, ground oats, sugar and salt in medium bowl. Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle with water; blend together with a fork until mixture holds together.
SHAPE dough into ball; place on lightly floured sheet of wax paper. Top with additional piece of wax paper. Roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Remove top sheet of wax paper and invert dough into 9-inch deep-dish (4-cup volume) pie plate. Slowly peel away wax paper. Trim excess crust. Turn edge under; crimp as desired.
TIPS:
â€¢ Substitute whole-wheat pastry flour for a finer textured, flakier pie crust.
â€¢ Oats can be finely ground in a food processor or blender.
â€¢ This whole-grain pie crust is great with LIBBY'SÂ® Famous or Lighter LIBBY'SÂ® Pumpkin Pie filling found on VeryBestBaking.com. No need to prebake the crust. Just substitute this crust for the deep-dish pie shell called for in the recipe. Follow the temperatures and bake times stated in the recipe.
â€¢ To make two crusts, double all ingredients, follow procedure above and divide dough in half.
â€¢ If a prebaked crust is needed for your recipe, preheat oven to 400Âº F. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cool completely on wire rack.

1 tablespoon orange zest
1/2 cup unsalted cold butter, cut into small pieces
3/4 cup half and half
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
Topping:
2 tablespoons half and half
Turbinado sugar
Directions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, set aside.
Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. In a small bowl, rub the sugar and orange zest together with your fingers. Whisk into the flour mixture.
Add cold butter pieces to the flour mixture. Cut in butter using a pastry blender, fork, or your hands. I prefer to use my hands. Mix until you have pea size chunks of butter.
In a small glass measuring cup, whisk the half and half, eggs, and vanilla extract together. Pour over dry ingredients and mix with a spatula until moist. Gently stir in the fresh cranberries. Transfer dough to a floured countertop and knead until dough comes together.
Shape dough into a large circle. Use a floured rolling pin to roll out the scone dough. Cut dough into wedges and place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush each scone with half and half and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar. Bake for 15-17 minutes, or until scones are golden brown. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
*Note-these scones are best eaten the day they are made. Serve with jam, butter, or enjoy plain.

Ingredients
1 qt. vinegar
3 tbsp. salt
1 gal sliced Cumbers
Syrup:
2 cups sugar
1 tsp. white mustard seed
1 tsp. celery seed
Directions
Let stand three hours.
Syrup Instructions:
Put Vinegar in a vessel and add ingredients.
Let come to a boil. Pack into hot sterilized jars and seal.
This recipe also calls for 1 tsp. of turmeric and 1tsp of ginger. But Mother doesnâ€™t use them, she doesnâ€™t like the taste ginger and turmeric turns everything yellow, doesnâ€™t look appetizing
How you slice pickle depends upon size of the cucumbers. If they are little small midget size they can be whole. If normal eating size slice in chip format (looks like quarter, or a 50 cent piece), if a little large slice in half lengthwise, then in half again (4 lengthwise pieces).

Turn, sear 2 minutes, and cook until 125Â°F. for rare, 135Â°F. for medium-rare, or to desired doneness. Remove with tongs to plates or platter. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt. If using, add cognac to pan and evaporate over medium heat (if heat is too high it will flame - this is not a problem just be aware). Add 1 tablespoon water and the Signature Sauce. Bring to low boil scraping up caramelized meat juices from pan. Whisk in remaining butter. Adjust pepper to taste.
Drizzle each steak with 2 tablespoons sauce, top with shiitake confit. Dot plate rims with a little more sauce if desired. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
Wine suggestion: Merlot or the same wine you used for the sauce.
Additional serving suggestions: Buttered steamed baby potatoes.
ADDITIONAL USAGE IDEAS
Use as marinade for thick tuna steaks (preferably the deep red variety), or salmon before grilling. Marinate up to 2 hours, no longer. Discard marinade or bring to boil and use as sauce.
Use to deglaze the roasting pan from a standing rib roast, and as sauce for the sliced beef. Add a few tablespoons of water for deglazing with the sauce.
Braised Root Vegetables: toss with a medley of root vegetables and braise slowly. (Carrots, turnips, Jerusalem artichokes, daikon radish, are good candidates).

Ingredients
4 large russet potatoes, about a pound each
Olive oil
1/2 cup milk
2 Tbsp butter, softened
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
4 strips bacon
Directions
1.  Bake the potatoes. Preheat the oven to 400F. Scrub the potatoes clean under running water. Poke each potato in several places with the tines of a fork so that when the potatoes are cooking they don't explode. Rub the potatoes all over with a little olive oil. Place directly on the middle or top rack of the oven. Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through. They should give a little when pressed.
2.  While the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Let cool. Crumble.
3.  Allow the potatoes to cool to touch. Slice the top third lengthwise off the potato. Use a spoon to scoop out the insides, forming a potato &quot;canoe&quot;, leaving about 1/4 inch of potato on the skin.
4.  Place the scooped out potato insides, sour cream, milk, cream, and butter into a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher. If you want a creamy texture, beat with an electric beater until desired consistency.
5.  Mix in the extras with the potatoes. Reserve some of the extras to sprinkle on the tops of the potatoes. Spoon fillings into the potato shells. Sprinkle with extra toppings.
6.  Heat oven to 350Â°F. Place potatoes on a roasting pan and bake 15 to 20 minutes until heated through.

Ingredients
20 small burger buns or English muffins, halved
40 oz ground beef
4 bottles Samuel Adams Boston Lager
sliced pickles
40 slices American cheese, cut in 1 inch x 1 inch pieces
20 tomato skewers
Directions
To make the ketchup: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, stir together the ketchup, mayonnaise, and lager. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. The ketchup will keep for up to 1 week.
To make the sliders: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a large mixing bowl, mix the ground beef with the lager. Scoop half of the bread from the bottom portion of the buns or English muffins. Press ground beef into the scooped out part of the bread and press the meat gently to fill the indentation and to mound it slightly. Lay the filled bun halves, meat sides down, on a baking sheet. Bake for about 3 minutes, just to brown the meat lightly. Remove the pan from the oven and turn the buns over. Top each with a slice of cheese, a few pickles and the top of the bun. Put the sliders on the baking sheet and return to the oven for about 5 minutes or until the meat is cooked to the desired degree of doneness. Skewer each of the tomatoes with a sturdy plastic or wooden skewer or toothpick and insert each skewer in the top of the slider. Serve the sliders with the ketchup.

Prep Time:

Servings:
2 crusts
Ingredients
Approx. 3 1/2 cups (20 oz.) unbleached all-purpose flour plus more for dusting
1 packet instant yeast aka: highly active or bread machine yeast
1 Tablespoon finely granulated salt
1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil plus more for your rising container, cookie sheet, pizza pan or screen
12oz. bottle of Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ® warmed up to 120Â°F-130Â°F
Directions
Preheat: Oven to 500Â°F
Warm the beer to 120Â°F-130Â°F (warming the beer properly means your yeast will activate properly). Warm the (open) bottle in a bowl of very warm (not boiling water) or by running it under hot water from the tap. A thermometer insures success - if you don't have one handy, the beer should feel very warm (not too hot) to the touch. In a 5 quart or larger bowl, combine flour, yeast, salt and oil. Add beer to flour mixture, and stir with a fork (not stirring with your hands just yet - it's too sticky at first) until the dough is lumpy. Then, go in with your hands. The dough will still be a little sticky, so gradually add flour as you knead to the point that the finished dough should be just slightly tacky and elastic. To tell when the dough is done, periodically poke it and when the dough gently springs back, it's done. Don't worry if it's not perfectly smooth - don't over knead it! Kneading: press down, push, fold, repeat. Your finished dough, will weigh right around 2 pounds (30-34 oz.). Break into two equal pieces - use a scale or eyeball it. Create a ball of each piece and place them in separate airtight containers lightly greased with olive oil. Each container needs to be at least a quart in size to allow for the dough to double in size (deli quart containers work great for this). Set dough aside to rise in a warm location, about 70Â°F-80F is good. After dough has expanded/up to doubling in size (about 1-2 hours), gently remove from container and stretch to fit on a lightly greased 12&quot; or 14&quot; cookie sheet, pizza pan or screen. Dress to your liking and bake in a 500Â°F preheated oven until your crust and toppings are to your desired doneness (about 10 to 15 minutes). Out of the oven, allow a few minutes to cool. Then cut, serve and enjoy.
For a thicker crust, stretch to 12&quot;. For a thinner crust, stretch to 14&quot;
Prep time: 15 minutes
Rise time: Between 1-2 hours in a warm spot (about 70Â°F-80Â°F)
10-15 minutes depending on your oven, toppings and desired doneness

Tangy Sambhar Powder
1/2 cup dried Thai, serrano or cayenne chiles
1/4 cup dried yellow split peas (chana dal), sorted
2 tablespoons sesame seed
1 tablespoon tamarind pulp or grated lime peel
1 tablespoon coriander seed
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
Curry
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon black or yellow mustard seed
1/4 teaspoon asafetida (hing), if desired
2 tablespoons dried yellow split peas (chana dal), sorted
1 large sweet potato, (1 lb), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
8 to 10 fresh karhi leaves or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water
Directions
In small bowl, mix all tangy sambhar powder ingredients. Heat 6-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Place mixture in skillet; cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until seeds crackle, spices turn 1 shade darker and the mixture has a nutty, pungent aroma. Transfer to a bowl; cool 8 to 10 minutes.

To make curry, in wok or deep 12-inch skillet, heat oil and mustard seed over medium-high heat. Once seed begins to pop, cover wok and wait until popping stops.
