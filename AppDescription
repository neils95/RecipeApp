This is a web application which allows users to search for the top 10 recipes for a given ingredient. 
Users can also input their own recipes which will affect the ranking of the other recipes. 
This was creted as a part of an advanced data structures course and we had to design and 
implement our own data storage methods. (Not allowed to use SQl or similar).

The following technlogies/languages were used for this.
Backend: Java
Frontend: CSS, Ajax, JS, Bootstrap, HTML
Server Side technology: JSP

We have not hosted this yet, so in order to view the application you can follow the instructions
